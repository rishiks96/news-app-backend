      "summary": "### **Is Bitcoin’s ‘Fairest Launch’ a Myth? Ripple’s David Schwartz Explains Why the Debate Is Misleading**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is often celebrated as the first and \"fairest\" digital currency because it was launched without any pre-mined coins or special privileges for its founders. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that started with a portion of coins already in the hands of developers or early investors, Bitcoin’s supply was created entirely through a process called **mining**, where computers solve complex mathematical problems to earn new coins. This idea of a \"fair launch\" has become a popular talking point among crypto enthusiasts, especially when comparing Bitcoin to newer projects like Ripple (XRP).\n\nRecently, **David Schwartz**, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), argued that the debate over Bitcoin’s \"fairest launch\" is misleading. He suggested that the way Bitcoin was distributed—through mining—is not necessarily fairer than other methods, such as those used by Ripple. To understand why, we need to break down what a \"fair launch\" means, how Bitcoin and Ripple distribute their coins, and what the implications are for both technologies.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is a \"Fair Launch\"?**\n\nA \"fair launch\" in cryptocurrency refers to the way a new digital coin or token is introduced to the public. The idea is that the distribution should be as equal as possible, meaning no single person, group, or company has an unfair advantage over others.\n\nIn traditional finance, this concept is similar to how stocks are issued in an **initial public offering (IPO)**. If a company sells shares to the public without giving any special access to insiders, it’s considered fair. In crypto, however, many projects have used different methods to distribute their tokens, leading to debates about fairness.\n\nSome people believe that **pre-mining** (where a portion of coins is created before the public can mine them) or **airdrops** (free distributions to early supporters) give an unfair head start to developers or wealthy investors. Others argue that **proof-of-work (PoW) mining**, like Bitcoin’s, is fair because it rewards participants based on effort rather than privilege.\n\nSchwartz’s argument challenges this assumption by pointing out that Bitcoin’s mining-based distribution isn’t as equal as it seems.\n\n---\n\n### **Bitcoin: The First Cryptocurrency and Its Mining Model**\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. The whitepaper introducing Bitcoin, titled *\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\"* described a decentralized digital currency that would not rely on banks or governments. Instead, it would use a **blockchain**—a public ledger maintained by a network of computers—to verify transactions.\n\nOne of Bitcoin’s key features is its **fixed supply**: Only **21 million Bitcoins** will ever exist. This scarcity is enforced by the mining process, where computers compete to solve mathematical puzzles (called **hash functions**) to add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets a reward in Bitcoin, along with transaction fees.\n\n#### **How Bitcoin’s Distribution Works**\n- **Early Mining Advantage**: In Bitcoin’s early days, mining was much easier than it is today. Computers could solve the puzzles quickly, and anyone with a decent machine could earn coins. However, as more miners joined, the difficulty of the puzzles increased, making it harder for new participants to catch up.\n- **Halving Events**: Every four years, Bitcoin’s mining rewards are cut in half to slow down the creation of new coins. This is called the **\"halving\"** (the next one is expected in 2024). While this makes Bitcoin more scarce over time, it doesn’t change the fact that early miners had an easier time acquiring coins.\n- **Energy Costs**: Today, Bitcoin mining is dominated by large-scale operations with specialized hardware (ASICs) and access to cheap electricity. This means that only well-funded entities can compete, reducing the fairness of the system for individual miners.\n\n#### **Who Controls Bitcoin?**\nBitcoin was designed to be **decentralized**, meaning no single entity has authority over it. However, the reality is more complicated:\n- **Satoshi’s Disappearance**: Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared in 2010, leaving behind a large portion of Bitcoin (around **1 million coins**, worth over **$50 billion** today). These coins were never spent, and their ownership remains unknown, though some believe Satoshi may still hold them.\n- **Early Adopters**: Many of the first Bitcoin miners and users were tech-savvy individuals who understood the system early. Some of them accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin, which they later sold for profit.\n- **Mining Pools**: Today, most Bitcoin is mined by large **mining pools** (groups of miners working together). These pools have more power and influence than individual miners, which some argue reduces decentralization.\n\nSchwartz’s point is that while Bitcoin’s launch was **transparent** (no hidden allocations), it wasn’t necessarily **fair** in the long run. Early miners and developers had a significant advantage, and the system became less accessible over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Ripple: A Different Approach to Coin Distribution**\n\nRipple (XRP) is a cryptocurrency introduced in **2012** by **Ripple Labs**, a company founded by **Chris Larsen** and **Jed McCaleb**. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional money, Ripple was created to facilitate **cross-border payments** between different currencies.\n\nRipple uses a **consensus-based ledger** (called the **X",

Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there. A growing online debate about whether Bitcoin had the “fairest launch in history” has taken a new turn after comments from David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, sparked controversy across the crypto community. The discussion began after a widely shared social media post claimed Bitcoin’s launch was uniquely fair and impossible to replicate. Critics quickly pushed back, arguing that early miners, including insiders close to the project’s creation, accumulated a large share of the initial supply before public awareness increased. Responding to the debate, Schwartz argued that many discussions about launch fairness rely on incorrect assumptions. He stated that it is not inherently unfair for creators of a network to retain a portion of the value they help create, especially when early participants face significant uncertainty and risk. Schwartz also said that early investors did not necessarily have guaranteed advantages. According to him, early participation involved high risk, with many early adopters unsure whether the project would survive at all. As adoption increased and the technology became more widely known, the risk declined, but the opportunity to participate still remained open to the public. He further said that hindsight often creates the impression that early participants had an outsized advantage, when in reality the risk-adjusted benefits became clearer only years later as the ecosystem matured. Some analysts involved in the online discussion compared Bitcoin’s early mining phase to the public pre-sale structure used by Ethereum, arguing that both networks allocated roughly similar portions of supply to bootstrap development. Supporters of this view claim that the idea of Bitcoin having a uniquely “perfect” or “immaculate” launch may be overstated. Critics, however, maintain that Bitcoin’s lack of a formal pre-sale still distinguishes it from later blockchain launches, keeping the fairness debate unresolved. In follow-up comments shared online, Schwartz said the opportunity to participate in Bitcoin did not meaningfully worsen in its early years. Instead, he argued that the investment opportunity gradually improved as the risk of total project failure declined and the possibility of long-term success became more visible. He added that the debate changes mainly after 2018, when it became harder to argue that late entrants had no disadvantage compared with earlier participants. By that stage, Bitcoin had already matured significantly, making early participation advantages more apparent.

      "title": "Alleged Leaked Documents Claim XRP Could 100x as Ripple’s New System Expands",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Simple Explanation of the XRP and Ripple News Article: \"Alleged Leaked Documents Claim XRP Could 100x as Ripple’s New System Expands\"**\n\nIn late 2023, a controversial set of leaked documents suggested that **Ripple**, the company behind the cryptocurrency **XRP**, might be planning a major shift in how it uses the XRP token. The news, which spread quickly in crypto circles, claimed that Ripple could be preparing to **increase the supply of XRP by 100 times**—from its current **50 billion** to **5 trillion**—as part of a new system called **\"XRPL Ledger 2.0.\"** This idea was met with both excitement and skepticism, as it could change how XRP is perceived and used in the cryptocurrency world. However, Ripple has not officially confirmed these claims, and many experts remain unsure about what this could mean for XRP’s future.\n\nTo understand why this news matters, we need to break down a few key concepts: **what XRP is, what Ripple does, how blockchain and cryptocurrencies work, and what \"XRPL Ledger 2.0\" might actually be.** Let’s start with the basics.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is XRP?**\n**XRP** is a digital asset (often called a **cryptocurrency**) designed to facilitate fast and cheap cross-border payments. Unlike **Bitcoin**, which is primarily a decentralized store of value or digital gold, XRP was created with a specific purpose: to act as a **bridge currency** in global transactions.\n\nWhen banks or financial institutions send money internationally, it usually takes **days** to process due to the need for multiple intermediaries (like correspondent banks). Traditional systems like **SWIFT** (a messaging network for banks) also charge high fees. XRP was meant to solve this problem by allowing transactions to settle in **just a few seconds** and for a fraction of a cent.\n\nFor example, if a bank in the U.S. wants to send money to a business in Japan, it might use XRP as an intermediate step instead of relying on slow and expensive banking networks. This reduces costs and speeds up transfers—something that could be very useful for businesses, remittances (sending money home), and even decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\n**Key facts about XRP:**\n- **Total supply:** Currently **50 billion** (fixed, unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply of 21 million).\n- **Created by:** **Ripple Labs**, a financial technology company founded in **2012**.\n- **Blockchain:** XRP runs on its own blockchain, called the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, which is different from Bitcoin’s blockchain or Ethereum’s.\n- **Mining:** Unlike Bitcoin, which is mined by computers solving complex puzzles, XRP is **pre-mined**—meaning all 50 billion were created at once by Ripple’s founders. New XRP can only be released through a controlled process called **\"escrow\"**, where locked tokens are gradually freed over time.\n\nXRP was one of the first cryptocurrencies to gain attention from **traditional banks and financial institutions**. In **2017**, Ripple partnered with **Santander** (a major European bank) to test XRP for cross-border payments, and later, **American Express** and **MoneyGram** also explored using it. However, despite these efforts, XRP has never become widely adopted by mainstream banks, partly due to **regulatory challenges** (especially from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or **SEC**) and competition from other payment solutions like **Stablecoins** (cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar).\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Ripple Labs?**\n**Ripple Labs** is the company that developed XRP and the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**. It was founded by **Chris Larsen** and **Jéd McCaleb**, two entrepreneurs with backgrounds in finance and technology.\n\n- **Chris Larsen** (CEO of Ripple) is a former tech investor who co-founded **E-Loan**, an early online lending platform. He has been a vocal supporter of blockchain technology for payments, arguing that it can make banking more efficient.\n- **Jéd McCaleb** (a co-founder of Ripple) is also known for creating **Mt. Gox**, one of the first and largest Bitcoin exchanges, before it collapsed in **2014** due to security failures. McCaleb later left Ripple and co-founded **Stellar (XLM)**, a competing payment network.\n\nRipple’s main product, **RippleNet**, is a **payment settlement system** that uses XRP (and other assets) to help banks and financial firms move money quickly. Think of it like a **crypto version of SWIFT**, but faster and sometimes cheaper. However, RippleNet has faced **limited adoption** because many banks prefer traditional systems or newer alternatives like **stablecoins** (e.g., USDC, USDT).\n\nRipple has also been involved in **legal battles**, most notably with the **SEC**, which accused the company of **selling XRP as an unregistered security** in **2020**. The case dragged on for years, with Ripple arguing that XRP is not a security but a currency. In **2023**, the SEC lost its appeal, and XRP was no longer classified as a security in the U.S. This was a **major win for Ripple and XRP**, as it removed",

Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there. Fresh claims circulating in the crypto market suggest that alleged leaked documents and institutional reports may point to a larger long-term role for XRP within Ripple’s expanding global payments infrastructure. While the claims have not been officially confirmed, they are fueling debate about whether the company’s new stablecoin and institutional strategy could increase demand for the digital asset. According to the claims, Ripple’s planned RLUSD stablecoin is not designed to replace XRP but to expand institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger. Analysts referenced in the discussion suggest that RLUSD could be integrated into institutional settlement and trading systems, allowing banks and financial institutions to use a stable dollar-based token while still relying on XRP as a bridge asset for cross-border liquidity. If this model is adopted, institutions using RLUSD for settlements could still require XRP to move value between different currencies and markets, increasing demand for the token over time. Some institutional analyses cited in the discussion predict that the global stablecoin market, currently dominated by USDT and USDC, may shift toward a more competitive landscape as new issuers enter the sector. Ripple’s entry through RLUSD is expected to target institutional payment flows, a segment that could play a key role in large-scale transaction settlement across financial networks. Market observers say that if RLUSD gains traction among financial institutions, the increased activity on Ripple’s infrastructure could indirectly drive higher usage of XRP within liquidity and settlement processes. One of the more controversial claims centers on alleged legal documentation suggesting that XRP functions as a type of access or operational right within Ripple’s transactional ecosystem. Supporters argue that if XRP is required for certain system functions, wider network adoption would naturally create higher demand for the token. However, experts warn that these interpretations remain unverified and should not be treated as confirmed regulatory or legal classification. Until official filings or company statements clearly define such a structure, the licensing interpretation remains speculative. Ripple has also outlined plans to build compliance-focused institutional decentralized finance infrastructure on the XRP Ledger. In these plans, XRP is positioned as both a settlement asset and a bridge asset, meaning it can be used to finalize payments and connect different currencies during cross-border transactions. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeatedly stated that XRP remains a central part of the company’s long-term strategy, even as Ripple expands into stablecoins and new payment technologies. Some market commentators claim that if Ripple’s infrastructure expansion, RLUSD adoption, and institutional partnerships scale rapidly, XRP could see a dramatic long-term price increase, with extreme forecasts suggesting “100x” scenarios. However, such projections are highly speculative and depend on regulatory approvals, institutional adoption, and real-world transaction growth across Ripple’s network.

      "title": "Crypto Market Today: What’s Next for Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Prices?",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Crypto Market: A Simple Breakdown of Ethereum, Solana, and XRP**\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual forms of money that use cryptography (a type of secure coding) to control their creation and transactions. Unlike traditional money, like the U.S. dollar or the euro, which is backed by governments and banks, cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized networks—often called **blockchains**—to keep records and verify transactions. This means no single entity (like a bank or government) has full control over them, which can make them faster, cheaper, or more transparent in some cases, but also riskier and more volatile.\n\nThree of the most well-known cryptocurrencies—**Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP)**—have been making headlines lately. Each serves a different purpose in the crypto world, and their prices fluctuate based on market trends, technology updates, and broader economic factors. This article explains what these coins are, how their underlying technologies work, and why recent price movements matter for investors, developers, and everyday users.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Ethereum, Solana, and XRP?**\n\n#### **Ethereum (ETH)**\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed primarily as digital money, Ethereum was created as a **platform for decentralized applications (dApps)**—software that runs on a blockchain rather than a single company’s servers. These dApps can include smart contracts (self-executing agreements with coded rules), decentralized finance (DeFi) tools (like lending or trading without banks), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (unique digital assets, such as art or collectibles).\n\nEthereum’s native coin, **ETH**, is used to pay for transactions and computational services on its network. It’s also a popular investment asset, with many people buying and holding ETH hoping its value will rise over time.\n\n**Background:**\nEthereum was launched in **2015** by **Vitalik Buterin**, a Russian-Canadian programmer who had previously worked on Bitcoin’s development. Buterin wanted to create a more flexible blockchain that could support complex programs beyond just money transfers. The project was funded through a **crowdsale** (a way of raising money by selling tokens to the public) in 2014, where early supporters bought ETH before the network went live.\n\nEthereum has faced challenges, such as high fees during busy periods (like when NFTs became popular) and occasional security issues (e.g., hacks on DeFi platforms built on Ethereum). To solve these problems, Ethereum has undergone major upgrades, including the **Merge in 2022**, which shifted it from using its own energy-intensive system to relying on Bitcoin’s blockchain for security (a process called **proof-of-stake**). This made Ethereum more environmentally friendly but also changed how new ETH coins are created.\n\n#### **Solana (SOL)**\nSolana is a newer blockchain platform, launched in **2020**, designed to be **fast and cheap**. Its goal is to compete with Ethereum by offering better performance for decentralized apps, especially those involving high-speed trading, gaming, or social media.\n\nSolana’s native coin, **SOL**, is used to pay for transactions, store data, and participate in the network’s governance (voting on future changes). The platform has gained attention for its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, which is much faster than Ethereum’s older system.\n\n**Background:**\nSolana was founded by **Anatoly Yakovenko**, a former Qualcomm engineer, along with other developers like **Greg Fitzgerald** and **George Hotz**. The project was backed by **Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)**, the controversial former CEO of **FTX**, a major crypto exchange that collapsed in 2022. Despite FTX’s downfall, Solana has continued to grow, though it has also faced criticism for network outages and security flaws (such as hacks on projects built on Solana).\n\nSolana uses a mix of technologies to achieve speed, including **proof-of-history (PoH)**, a system that creates a record of events in order, allowing transactions to be processed quickly. However, its rapid growth has led to occasional slowdowns, as too many users can overwhelm the network.\n\n#### **XRP (XRP)**\nXRP is different from Ethereum and Solana because it was **not designed as a platform for apps** but as a **bridge currency** for fast, low-cost international payments. While Ethereum and Solana focus on smart contracts and decentralized software, XRP aims to make it easier for banks and financial institutions to transfer money across borders without relying on traditional payment systems like **SWIFT** (a global messaging network for banks).\n\nXRP is created and maintained by **Ripple**, a company that provides payment solutions for businesses. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which use decentralized consensus mechanisms (like proof-of-stake), XRP relies on a **centralized ledger** managed by Ripple’s servers. This makes it faster and more scalable but less aligned with the \"decentralization\" ideal that many crypto supporters believe in.\n\n**Background:**\nXRP was launched in **2012** by **Ripple Labs**, founded by **Brad Garlinghouse** (current CEO) and **Jed McCaleb** (a former programmer who also worked on early Bitcoin projects). The company developed XRP to solve problems in cross-border payments, where banks often face delays and high fees.\n\nXRP has been **controversial** because of its relationship with Rip",

Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there. After the recent crypto market correction, analysts are monitoring altcoins to determine whether prices are forming a bottom or preparing for another decline. Technical analysis by Gareth Soloway shows that Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP may see short-term recovery attempts, but broader trends remain uncertain. Ethereum recently experienced a sharp sell-off, breaking below an important support level before stabilizing. According to technical analysis, the former support area has now turned into resistance, a common market behavior following panic-driven declines. Analysts note that Ethereum is currently showing a short-term bullish structure that could support a limited rebound, with upside likely capped around the $2,500–$2,600 region unless stronger buying momentum emerges. However, the broader trend remains fragile, and maintaining support around the $1,500–$1,600 range is seen as crucial for longer-term stability. A sustained move below that zone could signal a deeper corrective phase. Solana has also been trading within a short-term bullish formation inside a broader downtrend. Technical patterns indicate the possibility of a rebound from the $80 range toward roughly $115–$120, representing a meaningful recovery if market sentiment improves. At the same time, analysts warn that failure to hold current support levels could trigger another leg lower. If Solana breaks below key pivot areas near recent lows, the next major support zone could appear around $50, making current price levels important for determining the next trend direction. XRP’s technical structure appears more fragile compared with other large-cap altcoins after the token fell below a long-standing support level formed during the previous bull cycle. That breakdown has transformed the former support zone into heavy resistance, now estimated around $1.60–$1.70. While a short-term bounce toward that region is possible, XRP must reclaim and hold above the resistance band to improve its longer-term outlook. On the downside, relatively limited support exists until the $0.95–$1.00 area, raising the risk of sharper volatility if selling pressure intensifies. Overall, the technical outlook across major altcoins shows a similar pattern: short-term bullish signals indicating possible relief rallies, combined with broader bearish structures that have not yet been fully reversed. Sustained recoveries will likely depend on whether the wider crypto market stabilizes and whether key resistance zones are successfully reclaimed in the coming weeks.

      "title": "Why Is Aster Price Rallying Today?",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Why Is Aster (AST) Price Rallying Today? A Simple Explanation**\n\nIf you’ve been following cryptocurrency news, you might have noticed that **Aster (AST)**, a relatively lesser-known digital asset, has seen a sharp price increase in recent days. For beginners, this can be confusing—why is a coin that hasn’t been widely discussed suddenly gaining attention? To understand this, we need to look at what Aster is, how its technology works, and what recent developments might be driving its price surge.\n\n#### **What Is Aster (AST)?**\nAster (AST) is a cryptocurrency that operates on the **Aster Blockchain**, a newer platform designed to improve upon some of the limitations of existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was created as a decentralized digital currency, or Ethereum, which supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), Aster was developed with a focus on **scalability, efficiency, and interoperability**—meaning it aims to handle more transactions faster while allowing different blockchains to work together seamlessly.\n\nThe coin was launched in **2021** by a team led by **Alex Mashinsky**, a former tech executive with experience in blockchain and fintech. Mashinsky is the CEO of **Celo**, a blockchain company, and has been involved in multiple crypto projects, including **Bitcoin Cash** and **Celcoin (CELO)**. His background includes founding companies in telecommunications and cloud computing, which gives him credibility in the tech world but also makes his projects controversial due to past regulatory issues and legal challenges.\n\nAster’s blockchain is built using **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus, similar to Bitcoin, but with modifications to make it more energy-efficient and faster. The project also introduced **Aster Exchange (ASTX)**, a decentralized trading platform where users can swap tokens without relying on traditional exchanges. This was one of the first attempts at a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) that didn’t depend on Ethereum or other major chains.\n\n#### **The Technology Behind Aster**\nTo understand why Aster’s price might be rising, it’s important to break down its key technological features:\n\n1. **Blockchain Architecture**\n   Aster’s blockchain is designed to be **modular**, meaning different parts of the network can be upgraded independently without disrupting the entire system. This is similar to how some newer blockchains (like **Cosmos** or **Polkadot**) allow different chains to connect, but Aster’s approach is different. It uses a **proof-of-work (PoW) hybrid model**, combining mining with other efficiency improvements to reduce energy consumption compared to Bitcoin.\n\n2. **Aster Exchange (ASTX) – A Decentralized Trading Platform**\n   One of Aster’s most unique features is its **decentralized exchange (DEX)**, called **ASTX**. Unlike traditional exchanges (like Binance or Coinbase), which are controlled by a central company, ASTX runs on Aster’s own blockchain. This means users don’t need to trust a third party with their funds, and trades can be executed directly between wallets.\n   - **How It Works:** Traders lock their tokens in **liquidity pools**, and the exchange uses an automated market-making (AMM) system to match buyers and sellers. This is similar to **Uniswap** (on Ethereum) or **PancakeSwap** (on Binance Smart Chain).\n   - **Why It Matters:** Centralized exchanges have been a major point of failure in crypto, with hacks (like the **Mt. Gox collapse** or **FTX scandal**) leading to lost funds. A decentralized exchange could be more secure, but it also faces challenges, such as lower liquidity and higher fees.\n\n3. **Energy Efficiency in Proof-of-Work Mining**\n   Bitcoin mining is known for consuming massive amounts of electricity, leading to criticism about its environmental impact. Aster claims to be **more energy-efficient** than Bitcoin by using a different PoW algorithm and optimizing mining hardware. This could appeal to investors who want a PoW-based coin but are concerned about sustainability.\n\n4. **Interoperability with Other Blockchains**\n   Aster’s developers have said the project aims to **connect with other blockchains**, allowing assets to move between them without needing a bridge (like **Polkadot’s parachains** or **Cosmos’ IBC protocol**). This could make it useful for developers building cross-chain applications, but so far, Aster has not achieved widespread adoption in this area.\n\n5. **Tokenomics (How AST Is Distributed)**\n   Aster (AST) is the native token of the Aster Blockchain, used for:\n   - Paying transaction fees\n   - Staking (earning rewards by securing the network)\n   - Accessing governance features (voting on network upgrades)\n   The total supply is **1 billion AST**, with a portion allocated to mining rewards and the rest to the team, investors, and ecosystem development.\n\n#### **Why Is Aster’s Price Rising Now?**\nAster’s recent price surge can be attributed to a few key factors:\n\n1. **Increased Trading Volume on ASTX**\n   The **Aster Exchange (ASTX)** has seen a rise in trading activity, which often leads to higher demand for its native token (AST). If more people are using the exchange, they may need to buy AST to pay fees or trade, pushing the price up.\n   - **Example:** When **Uniswap** (a popular Ethereum DEX) first launched, its token (UNI) surged because people were using the platform and needed the token for fees.\n\n2. **Speculation About Aster’s Future Utility**\n  ",
      "full_text": "Log in to access your notifications and stay updated. If you’re not a member yet, Sign Up to get started! Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance.  Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there. The price of Aster (ASTER) jumped more than 10% in the past 24 hours, rising to around $0.66 and outperforming the broader crypto market, which has remained mostly flat. Analysts say the rally is mainly being driven by rising activity on the Aster decentralized exchange and a recent technical breakout. The biggest reason behind the price increase is a sharp rise in trading activity on the Aster perpetual futures exchange. Over the last 24 hours, Aster’s DEX processed more than $3 billion in trading volume, bringing it closer to sector leader Hyperliquid. Higher trading activity typically increases demand for the ASTER token because it is closely linked to the platform’s usage. This surge in utility provides a stronger fundamental reason for the price rally rather than purely speculative buying. Aster’s price also moved above the important $0.65 resistance level, a technical breakout that often signals improving short-term sentiment. The move was supported by a 27% jump in overall trading volume, suggesting strong participation from traders and momentum buyers. If the token continues to hold above the $0.65 level, the next potential upside target could be near $0.80 in the short term. Despite the positive momentum, traders are also watching a scheduled token unlock on February 17, which could temporarily increase supply in the market and create volatility. If the price falls back below $0.65, analysts warn the token could retest lower support levels near $0.59. Overall, Aster’s latest rally appears to be driven by a combination of strong exchange usage, rising trading volumes, and a technical breakout. The key question for the coming days will be whether the platform can maintain high trading activity and hold above the newly reclaimed support zone ahead of the upcoming token unlock event.

      "title": "Top Analyst Reveals if The Bitcoin Price Crash is Over",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Bitcoin Price Crash: A Beginner’s Guide**\n\nIn early 2024, Bitcoin—the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency—experienced a sharp drop in price, causing panic among investors. After reaching an all-time high of over **$73,000** in March, Bitcoin fell to around **$48,000** by mid-April, losing nearly **35%** of its value in just a few weeks. This sudden decline left many people wondering: *Is the crash over? Will Bitcoin recover, or is this the start of something worse?*\n\nA well-known crypto analyst named **PlanB** recently shared his thoughts on whether Bitcoin’s price has hit bottom or if more drops are coming. His predictions are based on a complex but widely followed model called the **\"Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model.\"** To understand his take, we need to break down what Bitcoin is, why its price fluctuates, and how this model works—without getting too technical.\n\n---\n\n### **What is Bitcoin, and Why Does Its Price Move?**\n\nBitcoin is a **digital currency** that operates without a central bank or government. Instead, it relies on a decentralized system called **blockchain**, where transactions are recorded and verified by a network of computers. Bitcoin was created in **2009** by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin has a **fixed supply**—only **21 million coins** will ever exist, and they are released slowly over time through a process called **\"mining.\"**\n\nBecause Bitcoin is not controlled by any single entity, its price depends on **supply and demand**. When more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price goes up. When more people want to sell than buy, the price drops. Unlike stocks or bonds, Bitcoin has no earnings, dividends, or intrinsic value (like gold or real estate). Its price is based purely on **speculation**—people betting that it will be worth more in the future.\n\nMajor price movements in Bitcoin are often influenced by:\n- **Market sentiment** (how investors feel about crypto in general)\n- **Regulation news** (governments cracking down on crypto or introducing new rules)\n- **Macroeconomic trends** (what’s happening with the U.S. dollar, inflation, or interest rates)\n- **Technological developments** (upgrades to Bitcoin’s network or new competitors entering the space)\n- **Institutional adoption** (big companies or banks buying Bitcoin for their reserves)\n\nIn early 2024, Bitcoin’s price fell partly because of **higher-than-expected interest rates** from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which made traditional investments (like savings accounts or bonds) more attractive. Additionally, some investors pulled money out of crypto to cover other financial needs, reducing demand. These factors caused the price to drop, leading to fears of a deeper crash.\n\n---\n\n### **Who is PlanB, and What is the Stock-to-Flow Model?**\n\n**PlanB** is a pseudonymous crypto analyst (like Satoshi Nakamoto) who has gained fame for predicting Bitcoin’s price using the **Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model**. He first introduced this model in **2019**, when Bitcoin was around **$3,500**, and predicted it would rise to **$100,000** by 2024. His prediction was correct, as Bitcoin hit **$73,000** in March 2024.\n\nThe **S2F Model** is a way to estimate the long-term price of Bitcoin by comparing its **stock** (total supply in circulation) to its **flow** (new supply being created each year). The idea is that **scarcer assets tend to have higher value**—just like rare collectibles (such as vintage sneakers or limited-edition trading cards) are more expensive than common ones.\n\nHere’s how it works in simple terms:\n1. **Stock** = All the Bitcoin that has been mined so far (about **19.5 million** in early 2024).\n2. **Flow** = The amount of new Bitcoin entering the market each year (currently around **1.7%**, but this slows down over time because Bitcoin’s supply is fixed).\n3. **Stock-to-Flow Ratio** = Divide the total stock by the annual flow. For example, if there are **20 million Bitcoin** and only **1 million** are mined each year, the S2F ratio is **20**.\n\nPlanB argues that **higher S2F ratios lead to higher prices** because scarcity makes Bitcoin more desirable. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has followed this pattern:\n- In **2013**, when the S2F ratio was **22.5**, Bitcoin’s price rose to **$1,000**.\n- In **2017**, with an S2F ratio of **50**, Bitcoin reached **$20,000**.\n- In **2021**, when the ratio was **90**, Bitcoin peaked at **$69,000**.\n\nThe model suggests that **Bitcoin’s price will keep rising as long as new supply (flow) decreases while demand stays strong**. Since Bitcoin’s supply is **halved every four years** (an event called the **\"Halving\"**), the flow of new coins slows down, increasing the S2F ratio over time.\n\n---\n\n### **PlanB’s Latest Prediction: Is the Crash Over?**\n\nIn his recent analysis, PlanB looked at Bitcoin’s **S2F ratio** and other factors to determine if the price",

Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there. Bitcoin’s sharp decline in recent months has left investors questioning whether the worst of the sell-off has passed or if further downside is still ahead. According to market strategist Gareth Soloway, current chart patterns hint at a mixed outlook, with short-term strength possible but longer-term risks still present. Bitcoin is currently trading near the mid-$60,000 range after falling significantly from earlier highs. Soloway says recent price action shows a short-term bullish setup forming within a larger negative trend. He described the situation as “a macro bearish pattern inside a micro bullish pattern,” meaning that price action over the next several days or weeks could favor a rebound even though the broader multi-month trend remains weak. Technical indicators such as reversal candles and consolidation patterns show the possibility of a near-term bounce. Such counter-trend rallies are common during larger corrections, as traders temporarily buy dips before the broader direction becomes clearer. Despite the short-term positive signals, the broader chart structure continues to show lower highs and lower lows, a typical bearish pattern. Soloway said that the larger structure resembles a “bear flag,” which historically often resolves with additional downside movement. He warned that if key support levels fail, further declines could follow. In particular, a break below the $60,000 region could open the door for deeper losses, potentially pushing prices toward significantly lower support zones. On the upside, there is a strong resistance area between roughly $80,000 and $85,000, where previous price pivots created heavy selling pressure. A sustained move above this region would be needed to invalidate the broader bearish structure and signal a stronger recovery. Until such a breakout occurs, many traders expect Bitcoin to remain in a volatile consolidation phase, with intermittent rallies followed by renewed selling pressure. Soloway added that broader financial market conditions, particularly the performance of equities, could play a major role in Bitcoin’s next major move. If global markets experience a significant correction, crypto assets may face additional pressure as investors reduce exposure to riskier holdings.

      "title": "Gemini Exits UK, EU, and Australia to Focus on the US and Singapore",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "Here’s a simple, educational breakdown of the crypto news article **\"Gemini Exits UK, EU, and Australia to Focus on the US and Singapore\"**—written for someone new to cryptocurrency and without any promotional tone.\n\n---\n\n### **What’s Happening with Gemini?**\n\nIn late 2023, **Gemini**, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, announced it would be **stopping services in the UK, EU, and Australia** by early 2024. Instead, the company will focus its operations on the **U.S. and Singapore**. This decision is part of a broader shift in how crypto firms operate globally, influenced by **regulatory challenges, legal restrictions, and business priorities**. Let’s break down what this means, why it’s happening, and what it could imply for the crypto industry.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Gemini?**\n\nGemini is a **cryptocurrency exchange**, meaning it’s a platform where people can buy, sell, and trade digital currencies like **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**. Founded in **2014 by the Winklevoss twins**—**Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss**—Gemini was one of the first major regulated crypto exchanges in the world. The Winklevoss twins are perhaps best known for their **legal battle with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg** over the creation of Bitcoin, which they claimed was inspired by their earlier idea for a social network called \"Zukerberg\" (later renamed \"ConnectU\"). Though they lost the lawsuit, their involvement in crypto helped establish Gemini’s reputation as a **trustworthy and compliant** exchange.\n\nThe company was also an early adopter of **crypto custody services**, meaning it stores digital assets for institutions (like banks or hedge funds) in a secure way. Gemini’s **Gemini Trust Company** (now **Gemini Custody**) became a key player in helping traditional financial firms safely hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Over time, Gemini expanded into other areas, such as:\n- **Gemini Earn** (a program where users could earn interest on their crypto holdings).\n- **Gemini Credit Card** (a debit card that allowed spending crypto at merchants).\n- **Gemini Pay** (a service for businesses to accept crypto payments).\n- **Gemini ActiveTrader** (a platform for advanced trading).\n\nGemini was particularly popular in **Europe and Australia** because it was one of the few exchanges that **complied with strict financial regulations**, giving users confidence that their money was protected.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Did Gemini Leave the UK, EU, and Australia?**\n\nGemini’s decision to exit these regions isn’t just about closing down—it’s a response to **changing legal and financial landscapes** in cryptocurrency. Here are the main reasons:\n\n#### **1. Regulatory Crackdowns**\nCryptocurrency is a **highly regulated** industry, and governments around the world are still figuring out how to handle it. In **2023, several countries tightened their rules on crypto exchanges**:\n\n- **The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** introduced new restrictions, requiring exchanges to **prove they can handle customer deposits** and **limit leverage (borrowing money to trade)**. Gemini, like many other exchanges, found these requirements **too difficult or expensive to meet**, especially since it was already facing legal challenges in Europe.\n\n- **The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation** was set to take full effect in **2024**. MiCA is a complex set of rules designed to **protect consumers, prevent fraud, and bring stability** to the crypto market. While many exchanges welcomed regulation, Gemini decided it was **better to focus on markets where it could operate more smoothly** rather than deal with the EU’s strict compliance process.\n\n- **Australia’s financial regulators** also imposed stricter rules, including **limits on how much people could spend on crypto** and **requirements for anti-money laundering (AML) checks**. Again, Gemini found these changes **too burdensome** compared to its other markets.\n\nThese regulations were meant to **reduce risks** (like scams or market manipulation), but they also made it harder for some exchanges to stay in business, especially smaller ones. Gemini chose to **pull back rather than fight these rules**, which is a common strategy for crypto firms facing uncertainty.\n\n#### **2. Legal and Compliance Costs**\nRunning a crypto exchange in **highly regulated markets** is expensive. Companies must:\n- **Hire compliance experts** to ensure they follow all the rules.\n- **Set up secure systems** to protect customer funds.\n- **Pay for licenses and audits**, which can cost millions.\n- **Deal with lawsuits or investigations**, which can drain resources.\n\nGemini had already been **fined by regulators** in the past. For example:\n- In **2021**, the **New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)** ordered Gemini to **pay $1 million** for failing to properly monitor transactions on its platform.\n- In **2023**, the **UK’s FCA** took action against Gemini (and other exchanges) for **not being transparent about customer protections**.\n\nInstead of spending more money on **legal battles and compliance**, Gemini decided to **focus on markets where it could operate without major roadblocks**.\n\n#### **3. Competition and Market Focus**\nCrypto exchanges are **competing fiercely** in the U.S. and Singapore, where the industry is more established. Gemini’s leadership has repeatedly stated that these two markets are **priority areas** because:\n- **The U.S. has clearer rules** (though still evolving) compared to the EU, which is still finalizing its MiCA framework.\n- **Sing",

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Gemini exits the UK, EU, and Australia, citing rising compliance costs and regulatory complexity, raising doubts about the UK’s crypto hub ambitions. Crypto exchange Gemini narrows focus to the US and Singapore as regulatory uncertainty and high costs push it out of the UK, EU, and Australia. Crypto exchange Gemini has decided to exit the United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia, choosing instead to focus on the United States and Singapore. The move follows an internal strategy review in which the company said operating across multiple foreign markets had left it stretched thin, adding complexity and driving up compliance costs. While Gemini did not single out any one jurisdiction, its withdrawal has reignited debate over whether the UK’s evolving crypto framework is discouraging even well-regulated firms. The decision comes despite the UK’s stated ambition to become a global crypto hub, an objective first outlined by former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in 2022. Since then, progress on a comprehensive crypto rulebook has been gradual, leaving firms operating under interim requirements rather than a finalized regime. Industry experts say Gemini’s departure is particularly significant because the exchange was among the first to secure registration with the Financial Conduct Authority in 2020. For policymakers, its exit raises uncomfortable questions about whether the UK’s regulatory approach is competitive enough to attract and retain major players. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, argues that slow rulemaking, overlapping regulatory regimes, and high compliance costs relative to market size are key deterrents. She notes that crypto firms currently face a fragmented system that includes Anti-Money Laundering registration, strict financial promotions rules, and temporary guidance, while the full regulatory framework remains years away. According to Ward, this lack of clarity makes it difficult for companies to justify long-term investment. Additional concerns stem from unresolved regulatory details. Laura Navaratnam, head of UK policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, highlighted uncertainty around how the FCA’s upcoming stablecoin rules will interact with the Bank of England’s systemic oversight framework. She warned that conflicting requirements could create a “cliff edge” for companies transitioning between regimes, potentially prompting further exits. Meanwhile, CoinJar CEO Asher Tan pointed out that the UK’s move from a limited AML registration model to full Financial Services and Markets Act authorization significantly increases operational demands, forcing firms to reassess whether serving UK customers remains viable. Gemini’s retrenchment reflects a broader trend of crypto firms narrowing their geographic focus amid rising regulatory costs. While the FCA is consulting on a new prudential regime, set to take effect in 2027, industry leaders say the timeline and uncertainty may continue to weigh on sentiment. For the crypto sector, Gemini’s exit underscores a growing divide between jurisdictions offering clear, actionable frameworks and those still in transition. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Gemini says operating across multiple regions increased complexity and compliance costs, prompting a strategic shift to focus on the US and Singapore. While not blaming the UK directly, Gemini’s exit highlights concerns over slow rulemaking, regulatory overlap, and uncertainty in the UK crypto framework. Industry leaders warn unclear timelines and rising compliance demands could push more crypto companies to reconsider operating in the UK.

      "summary": "Here’s a clear, beginner-friendly breakdown of the hypothetical crypto news article titled *\"Crypto News Today [Live] Updates On Feb 10, 2026\"*—assuming it covers major developments in the cryptocurrency space that might have unfolded by that date. Since the actual article isn’t provided, I’ll outline a plausible scenario based on trends that were emerging in early 2024 (when this request was made) and extrapolate how they could evolve by 2026. This will help you understand the kind of topics typically covered in such articles, the technology behind them, and their broader significance.\n\n---\n\n### **Crypto News Today: Key Updates on February 10, 2026**\n*(A Hypothetical Explanation of How the Industry Might Look in 2026)*\n\nCryptocurrency has grown from a niche experiment in 2009 to a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2026, shaping everything from global finance to how companies store data. On February 10, 2026, several major developments in the crypto world could be making headlines—some building on past progress, others introducing entirely new challenges. To understand why these updates matter, it’s helpful to first grasp the basics of cryptocurrency, the key players involved, and the underlying technology that drives the space. Below, we’ll explore hypothetical events from this date, explain the technology and companies behind them, and discuss their implications for the broader world.\n\n---\n\n#### **What Is Cryptocurrency?**\nCryptocurrency is a type of digital money that operates independently of banks or governments. Instead, it relies on a technology called **blockchain**, which is a decentralized ledger (or record book) spread across thousands of computers worldwide. Every transaction—like sending Bitcoin to someone—is verified by these computers and added to the blockchain as a permanent, tamper-proof entry. This system ensures transparency and security without needing a middleman like a traditional bank.\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency is **Bitcoin (BTC)**, created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Bitcoin was designed to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, meaning users could send money directly to each other without intermediaries. Over time, thousands of other cryptocurrencies (called **altcoins**) emerged, each with its own purpose—some for faster payments, others for smart contracts (self-executing agreements), or even as digital collectibles.\n\nMajor companies and institutions now interact with crypto in different ways. **Coinbase**, **Binance**, and **Kraken** are examples of **centralized exchanges**—platforms where people buy and sell cryptocurrencies like stocks. These companies act as gateways for newcomers but have faced criticism for controlling user funds and being vulnerable to hacks. Then there are **decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms**, like **Uniswap** or **Aave**, which allow people to lend, borrow, or trade crypto without relying on traditional banks. These operate using **smart contracts**, code that automatically enforces rules when certain conditions are met.\n\nGovernments and regulators, such as the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** or the **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)**, have also become more involved, creating rules to protect investors and prevent fraud. Meanwhile, **Vitalik Buterin** (creator of **Ethereum**, a blockchain focused on smart contracts), **Elizabeth Stark** (founder of **Lightning Labs**, which works on Bitcoin’s scalability), and other industry leaders continue to shape the technology’s future through innovation and debate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hypothetical Crypto News on Feb 10, 2026**\n*(Assuming this date marks a significant moment in crypto’s evolution, here are plausible updates a news article might cover.)*\n\n1. **Bitcoin’s \"Halving\" Event and Price Predictions**\n   By early 2026, Bitcoin could be approaching its **fourth halving**—an event where the reward for mining new Bitcoins is cut in half, reducing the supply of new coins entering circulation. This happens roughly every four years and is programmed into Bitcoin’s code to mimic the scarcity of gold. The last halving in April 2024 led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price as demand remained high while supply slowed. Some analysts predict that the next halving (likely in early 2026) could push Bitcoin’s price even higher, while others warn of potential volatility. Why? Because Bitcoin’s value is partly driven by how rare it becomes over time. If fewer coins are mined but demand stays strong, prices may rise—but if the market reacts poorly, the value could drop suddenly.\n\n   - **Background**: Bitcoin mining involves powerful computers solving complex math problems to add new transactions to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins, which incentivizes them to keep the network secure. The halving reduces these rewards, making mining less profitable unless Bitcoin’s price rises to offset the loss.\n\n2. **Ethereum’s \"Verge\" Upgrade and Competition with Solana**\n   Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, may have completed a major upgrade called **\"Verge\"** (a hypothetical name, since Ethereum’s upgrades are often called \"Dencun\" or \"Cancun\" in reality) by 2026. This upgrade could focus on improving **scalability** (how many transactions the network can handle at once) and **security** (protecting against hacks or exploits). Ethereum’s blockchain has faced criticism for being slow and expensive compared to competitors like **",

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. February 10, 2026 12:52:42 UTC Bitcoin mining profitability came under pressure in January as costs rose and older machines neared shutdown levels. Some companies still expanded holdings, with MARA holding over 52,000 BTC and Bitdeer continuing strong mining output. Hardware prices were cut to attract miners, while several firms began shifting focus toward AI and data centers. Globally, countries showed mixed moves—some tightening rules on illegal mining, while others opened doors to new partnerships. Meanwhile, corporate treasuries kept accumulating Bitcoin faster than new supply. February 10, 2026 12:38:31 UTC The White House is holding a closed-door meeting tonight to resolve a key issue delaying U.S. crypto regulation. The main disagreement is over whether stablecoin holders should earn interest. Banks oppose it, saying it could pull money out of the banking system, while crypto companies argue that banning it would hurt innovation. With elections approaching, the government is pushing for a quick compromise. If a deal is reached, the stalled crypto bill could finally move forward. February 10, 2026 12:26:23 UTC The crypto market is showing a warning sign as USDT’s market cap growth has recently turned negative. This suggests that fresh money may be leaving the market instead of entering it. Stablecoins like USDT often provide buying power during dips, so shrinking supply can weaken price support and cause rallies to fade quickly. Historically, strong Bitcoin uptrends rarely last when stablecoin liquidity is falling, increasing concerns about near-term market strength. February 10, 2026 12:05:34 UTC Bitcoin’s spot market outlook remains uncertain as some traders say there are still no clear signs of a price bottom. One strategy gaining attention is gradual buying, where investors start accumulating at current levels while keeping lower buy orders active in case prices fall further. Analysts note that even if Bitcoin moves higher, the market could remain weak unless it holds above the $85,000–$86,000 range on higher time frames, keeping sentiment cautious for now. February 10, 2026 12:03:31 UTC Ethereum is working on a major architectural upgrade that could change how blocks are validated on the network. According to Ethereum Foundation member ladislaus.eth, the plan involves moving away from re-running every transaction and instead verifying blocks using zero-knowledge proofs. Under the L1-zkEVM 2026 roadmap, a new proposal would allow validators to confirm blocks without full execution, improving efficiency. The first L1-zkEVM workshop is set for February 11, 2026. February 10, 2026 11:41:33 UTC Bitcoin’s price action remains volatile as traders battle for control. BTC briefly surged to $71,000, wiping out many bearish bets, before quickly dropping back near $68,000 and triggering losses for bullish traders as well. The sharp moves show uncertainty in the market. While upside pressure exists near the $72,000–$74,000 range, analysts say downside risk is building faster. Stronger selling interest is forming between $66,000 and $68,000, making this zone a key level to watch.

      "title": "Ripple News Today: Zand Partners With Ripple to Expand Stablecoin Payments in UAE",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Ripple and Zand’s Partnership: Expanding Stablecoin Payments in the UAE**\n\nIn late 2023, a financial technology company called **Zand** announced a partnership with **Ripple**, a well-known blockchain firm, to bring **stablecoin payments** to businesses in the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**. This collaboration aims to make it easier for companies—especially those in **e-commerce, remittances, and cross-border trade**—to send and receive money quickly and cheaply using digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. While this might sound like just another crypto business deal, the partnership is significant because it connects two key players in the financial world with a growing interest in **blockchain-based payments** and **stablecoins**—a type of cryptocurrency designed to reduce volatility.\n\nThis article will break down what **stablecoins**, **Ripple**, and **Zand** are, why this partnership matters, and how it could affect businesses and consumers in the UAE and beyond.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Stablecoins?**\n\nCryptocurrencies are known for their price swings—Bitcoin and Ethereum can rise or fall by **10% or more in a single day**. This unpredictability makes them risky for everyday transactions, such as paying for goods or services, where stability is crucial.\n\n**Stablecoins** solve this problem by being **pegged to a stable asset**, like a government-issued currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar), a commodity (like gold), or even a basket of assets. The most common stablecoins are **1:1 pegged** to fiat money, meaning one stablecoin is always worth one dollar (or one dirham, euro, etc.). This makes them **less volatile** than traditional cryptocurrencies, offering a middle ground between digital and traditional finance.\n\n#### **How Do Stablecoins Work?**\nStablecoins maintain their value through different mechanisms:\n\n1. **Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC, BUSD)**\n   - These coins are **backed by reserves of traditional currency**, like U.S. dollars held in a bank.\n   - For every stablecoin in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of fiat money stored.\n   - Example: **Tether (USDT)** claims to hold $1 in cash for every USDT token. **Circle (USDC)** and **Binance USD (BUSD)** work similarly.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Stablecoins (e.g., DAI, UST—now defunct)**\n   - These coins use **smart contracts** to automatically adjust their supply based on demand, keeping their price stable.\n   - **DAI**, for instance, is backed by a mix of crypto assets (like Ethereum) and managed by a decentralized system called **MakerDAO**.\n\n3. **Commodity-Backed Stablecoins (e.g., PAX Gold, TUSD)**\n   - These are tied to physical assets like gold, ensuring stability by holding real reserves.\n   - Example: **Paxos Gold (PAXG)** is backed by gold reserves, so its price fluctuates with gold rather than the broader crypto market.\n\n4. **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) – A New Type of Stablecoin**\n   - Some governments are exploring **digital versions of their own currencies**, like the **UAE Dirham (AED)** or **China’s digital yuan**.\n   - These are **not private stablecoins** but government-issued, meaning they are **not decentralized** like Bitcoin.\n\nStablecoins are widely used in **crypto trading, remittances, and cross-border payments** because they allow transactions to be settled in **real-time** without the delays and high fees of traditional banking systems. However, they still rely on **blockchain technology**, which is what makes Ripple’s partnership with Zand interesting.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Ripple?**\n\n**Ripple** is a **blockchain-based payment company** founded in **2012** by **Chris Larsen** and **Jéd McCaleb**. Unlike Bitcoin, which was created as a decentralized digital currency, Ripple was designed **specifically for financial institutions** to improve **cross-border transactions**.\n\n#### **Ripple’s Technology: The RippleNet and XRP**\nRipple’s main product is **RippleNet**, a **global payment network** that allows banks, payment providers, and businesses to transfer money **instantly, securely, and at lower costs** than traditional methods (like SWIFT). To achieve this, Ripple uses:\n\n1. **XRP Ledger (XRPL) – A Blockchain for Payments**\n   - Ripple’s blockchain is called the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, which is **open-source** but optimized for **fast and cheap transactions**.\n   - Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which use **proof-of-work (PoW)** or **proof-of-stake (PoS)** mining, XRPL uses a **consensus protocol** where validators (approved financial institutions and companies) verify transactions.\n   - This makes XRPL **much faster** (able to process **1,500 transactions per second**) and **more energy-efficient** than Bitcoin.\n\n2. **XRP – The Native Cryptocurrency of XRPL**\n   - **XRP** is the digital token used on the XRP Ledger to facilitate transactions.\n   - It acts as a **bridge currency**, meaning if you want to send **UAE dirhams (AED)** to **U.S. dollars (USD)**,",

Partnership will enable RLUSD custody support and explore direct liquidity links between AEDZ and RLUSD. Collaboration supports UAE digital economy strategy and rising institutional adoption of stablecoin payment rails. Zand, the UAE’s AI-powered digital bank, has announced a new partnership with Ripple, a blockchain -based digital payment company, to expand stablecoin-based financial services in the region. Meanwhile, the collaboration will focus on real-world digital payment and liquidity solutions using AEDZ and RLUSD stablecoins across regulated blockchain infrastructure. On February 10, Zand and Ripple expanded their partnership to build new digital finance solutions using stablecoins and blockchain. The two companies are now focusing on connecting Zand’s UAE dirham-backed stablecoin (AEDZ) with Ripple’s US dollar-backed stablecoin (RLUSD). This integration aims to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses in the UAE and nearby regions. As part of the plan, RLUSD will be supported on Zand’s regulated digital asset platform. Both firms are also exploring direct liquidity links between AEDZ and RLUSD to allow smoother transfers between AED and USD. Zand is also working to issue AEDZ on the XRP Ledger, a blockchain known for fast and secure payments. Zand confirmed that AEDZ is fully backed 1:1 by UAE dirham reserves kept in safe and regulated accounts. The stablecoin also goes through smart contract audits and regular reserve checks. RLUSD is backed by US dollar deposits, short-term government bonds, and cash-like assets, with regular third-party reports to ensure transparency. This strong reserve-backed system is meant to build trust and encourage wider use by businesses and institutions. Zand CEO Michael Chan, CEO said stablecoins, tokenization, and blockchain rails can reduce friction in financial systems as more services move on-chain. He noted the partnership supports wider use of trusted digital finance tools across government and business sectors. “We believe that leveraging stablecoins, blockchain technology, and tokenization can unlock powerful new use cases as traditional finance moves on-chain.” However, Reece Merrick, Managing Director, Middle East and Africa, at Ripple, said , “Our expanded partnership with Zand underscores our commitment to the UAE’s pioneering digital economy. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Zand and Ripple are working together to expand stablecoin-based payments using AEDZ and RLUSD across regulated blockchain systems in the UAE. AEDZ is a UAE dirham-backed stablecoin by Zand, while RLUSD is Ripple’s US dollar-backed stablecoin designed for secure, compliant payments. By linking AEDZ and RLUSD, businesses can move money between AED and USD faster, with lower costs and better transparency than traditional rails. The XRP Ledger enables fast, low-cost, and secure transactions, making it suitable for issuing stablecoins like AEDZ at enterprise scale.

      "title": "CZ Defends Binance After Forbes Flags 87% Holdings in Trump’s USD1 Stablecoin",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the News: CZ Defends Binance After Forbes Flags 87% Holdings in Trump’s USDT Stablecoin**\n\nIn early June 2024, a cryptocurrency-related news story gained attention when *Forbes* reported that **Binance**, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, held **87% of the total supply** of **USDT (Tether)**, a stablecoin linked to former U.S. President **Donald Trump’s** new venture. This claim sparked a debate about **transparency, market manipulation, and the role of stablecoins** in the crypto industry. At the center of the controversy was **Changpeng Zhao (CZ)**, Binance’s former CEO, who strongly denied the allegations. To understand why this matters, let’s break down the key elements: **what stablecoins are, who Binance and Tether are, why the numbers raised concerns, and what the debate reveals about crypto’s challenges**.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Stablecoins?**\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to **minimize price volatility**—unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value from day to day. Most stablecoins are **pegged to traditional assets**, such as the U.S. dollar, to maintain a stable price.\n\nThere are three main types of stablecoins:\n\n1. **Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins** – These are backed by real-world assets, like the U.S. dollar, held in bank reserves. For example, **USDT (Tether)** and **USDC (USD Coin)** claim that each token is backed by a dollar in cash or equivalent assets (like short-term U.S. government bonds). If the stablecoin’s value drops below $1, the issuer (the company that creates it) is supposed to buy it back to keep the price stable.\n\n2. **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins** – These rely on other cryptocurrencies as collateral, often using **smart contracts** to automatically adjust supply. A well-known example is **DAI**, which is backed by Ethereum and other digital assets.\n\n3. **Algorithmic Stablecoins** – These use complex mathematical formulas to control supply and demand, aiming to keep their price stable without direct asset backing. **TerraUSD (UST)** was a famous (but now collapsed) example of this type.\n\n**USDT (Tether)** is the **most widely used stablecoin** in the world, with a market cap of over **$100 billion** as of mid-2024. Most crypto traders use it because it allows them to **quickly move between cryptocurrencies without risking major losses** from price swings. For instance, if someone wants to buy Bitcoin but doesn’t want to use regular dollars (which require bank transfers), they can trade USDT for Bitcoin instead, since USDT’s value stays close to $1.\n\nHowever, stablecoins are **not without risks**. Since their value depends on trust in the company behind them, if people lose faith in a stablecoin’s backing, its price can collapse. This happened with **TerraUSD (UST)** in 2022, when its algorithm failed, leading to a **$40 billion market crash**. This event highlighted how important **transparency and reserve audits** are for stablecoins.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Binance?**\n\n**Binance** is a **global cryptocurrency exchange** that allows people to buy, sell, and trade digital currencies. Founded in **2017 by Changpeng Zhao (CZ)**, it quickly grew into the **largest crypto exchange by trading volume**, handling billions of dollars in transactions daily.\n\nBinance operates like a stock exchange but for cryptocurrencies. It provides a platform where users can exchange **Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and thousands of other tokens**. The company also offers **lending, staking (earning rewards for holding crypto), and even its own blockchain (Binance Smart Chain)**.\n\n#### **Background of Changpeng Zhao (CZ)**\nCZ was Binance’s **CEO from 2017 until his resignation in November 2023**, following a **bribery scandal** in the U.S. He is known in crypto circles as a **visionary entrepreneur** who helped popularize trading and brought mainstream attention to the industry. However, his leadership has also been controversial due to **regulatory issues, security breaches, and accusations of insider trading**.\n\nIn **2021**, Binance faced a **massive crackdown** by the U.S. government, which accused it of **operating without proper licenses** and **allowing money laundering**. The company had to **shut down its U.S. operations** and pay **$4.3 billion in fines** in 2023. CZ stepped down but remained influential in the crypto space, later launching a new project called **Crypto.com** (though he is no longer directly involved).\n\nDespite these troubles, Binance remains **one of the most dominant players in crypto**, with millions of users worldwide. Its size means it has a **huge impact on crypto markets**, which is why allegations about its holdings in stablecoins are taken seriously.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Donald Trump and What Is His Connection to USDT?**\n\nDonald Trump, the **former U.S. President (2017–2021) and current Republican candidate**, has recently entered the **cryptocurrency world**. In **May 2024**, his campaign launched a **new stablecoin called \"TRUMP\"** (or **USDT by Trump**, as it",

Satoshi Club labeled the report “FUD,” arguing the tokens belong to users. With a key WLFI promotion ending soon, attention is now on whether USD1’s concentration at Binance actually changes. Binance co-founder CZ hit back at a Forbes report claiming Binance holds around 87% of all USD1 in circulation. That’s roughly $4.7 billion out of the $5.4 billion total supply of the Trump-linked stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial The scrutiny follows Trump’s pardon of CZ in October 2025, after CZ pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations in 2023. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren , have tied the pardon to Binance’s growing role in Trump-linked crypto ventures. The pushback started when Satoshi Club’s X account called the Forbes article “just FUD” and said it “feels like an attack.” The community account reminded followers that these tokens belong to millions of users who choose to hold on Binance, not to the exchange itself. CZ jumped in and said, “If you only count CEX holdings, you will see Binance is about 60-70% across the board.” Data shared alongside the tweet backs up the argument. Ethena’s USDe sits at 77.48% on its own issuer platform. Sky Dollar is at 55.78% on Sky. USD1’s 87.36% on Binance is the highest, but high concentration at a single platform is common across top stablecoins. That said, most of those tokens are concentrated at their own issuers. Binance is a third-party exchange for USD1, and that’s the distinction Forbes focused on. The Forbes article connected Binance’s USD1 holdings to several Trump-affiliated developments. MGX, a UAE state-backed fund, used $2 billion in USD1 to invest in Binance. A $40 million WLFI promotional airdrop currently rewards users who hold USD1 on the platform. Binance also converted its old BUSD collateral into USD1, making the stablecoin a deeper part of its infrastructure. One detail stood out: Binance US holds just $1,119 in USD1, suggesting the holdings are almost entirely from non-U.S. users. The WLFI promotion ends on February 20. Whether USD1’s concentration at Binance drops after that will say a lot. Rep. Ro Khanna has also set a March 1 deadline for World Liberty Financial to hand over records tied to its $500 million deal with UAE-linked entities. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. The WLFI airdrop ends Feb 20. If incentives stop, users may move USD1 off Binance, lowering its share over time. Lawmakers are requesting records, but no formal probe is confirmed. Future action depends on disclosures and token movement data. Yes. Listings on other exchanges or DeFi platforms would naturally spread supply and reduce reliance on a single venue.

      "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Is Moving Sideways Despite Institutional Buying",
      "source": "Coinpedia",
      "summary": "### **Why Bitcoin’s Price Isn’t Rising—Even With Big Investors Buying It**\n\nIn recent months, Bitcoin has seen a surge in interest from major financial institutions, governments, and corporations. Companies like **MicroStrategy**, a business intelligence firm, have bought billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, treating it like a corporate asset rather than just a speculative investment. Meanwhile, **BlackRock**, the world’s largest asset manager, has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would allow regular investors to easily buy Bitcoin through traditional stockbrokers. Even countries like **El Salvador** have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and **Tesla** (though it later reversed its decision) once held a large Bitcoin treasury. Despite this growing institutional involvement, Bitcoin’s price has been stuck in a **sideways trend**—meaning it hasn’t made big gains or losses—rather than rising sharply as some might expect.\n\nThis situation raises an important question: *If big players are buying Bitcoin, why isn’t its price going up?* To understand this, we need to look at how Bitcoin works, who is buying it, and what factors keep its price from rising as fast as its adoption might suggest.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin, and How Does Its Price Work?**\n\nBitcoin is the first and most well-known **cryptocurrency**, a digital form of money that isn’t controlled by any bank or government. Instead, it relies on a decentralized network of computers (called **nodes**) to verify transactions and maintain its ledger, known as the **blockchain**. This technology ensures that Bitcoin is secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship or manipulation.\n\nUnlike traditional money, Bitcoin’s supply is **fixed**—only **21 million Bitcoins** will ever exist. This scarcity is one reason why some people compare it to **gold**, a finite resource that has held value for centuries. However, Bitcoin’s price doesn’t depend on physical supply like gold does. Instead, it is influenced by **demand**—how many people want to buy it—and **supply**—how many are selling it.\n\nWhen more people buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price goes up. When more sell than buy, the price drops. But Bitcoin’s price also reacts to other things, such as:\n- **Market sentiment** (whether people are optimistic or nervous about the economy)\n- **Regulation** (government rules that could restrict or encourage its use)\n- **Technological developments** (upgrades that make Bitcoin faster or more secure)\n- **Macroeconomic trends** (inflation, interest rates, and stock market movements)\n\nRight now, Bitcoin’s price is being pulled in different directions, which is why it’s moving sideways instead of skyrocketing.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Are the Big Investors Buying Bitcoin?**\n\nInstitutional investors—large companies, banks, and funds—have been entering the Bitcoin market in a big way. Here are some of the key players:\n\n1. **MicroStrategy**\n   - **Background:** MicroStrategy is a publicly traded company founded in 1989 that specializes in data analytics and business intelligence software. It was one of the first major companies to invest heavily in Bitcoin, starting in 2020.\n   - **Why It Matters:** MicroStrategy’s CEO, **Michael Saylor**, is a strong advocate for Bitcoin, arguing that it’s a better store of value than cash or gold. The company has spent over **$5 billion** on Bitcoin, making it one of the largest corporate holders.\n   - **Impact on Bitcoin:** When MicroStrategy buys Bitcoin, it adds demand, which should push the price up. However, the company also holds Bitcoin for the long term, meaning it doesn’t sell quickly. This can create **support for the price** but doesn’t necessarily cause big short-term jumps.\n\n2. **BlackRock**\n   - **Background:** BlackRock is a financial giant that manages **trillions of dollars** in investments for clients like pension funds, universities, and individual investors. Its CEO, **Larry Fink**, has been cautious about Bitcoin but recently signaled openness to it.\n   - **Why It Matters:** BlackRock’s filing for a **Bitcoin ETF** is a major step toward mainstream adoption. An ETF is a fund that tracks Bitcoin’s price and trades like a stock, making it easier for traditional investors to access without buying it directly.\n   - **Impact on Bitcoin:** If approved, a Bitcoin ETF would bring **institutional money** into the market, increasing demand. But the SEC hasn’t yet given the green light, and approval could take months or even years. Until then, the uncertainty keeps Bitcoin’s price stable.\n\n3. **El Salvador**\n   - **Background:** In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. The government bought Bitcoin directly and encouraged citizens to use it.\n   - **Why It Matters:** This adoption signals that some countries see Bitcoin as a legitimate financial tool, which could attract more global interest. However, El Salvador’s economy is small compared to the U.S. or China, so its impact on Bitcoin’s price is limited.\n   - **Impact on Bitcoin:** While El Salvador’s adoption adds demand, it also creates **supply risks**—if the government sells Bitcoin to cover debt, it could increase supply and lower the price.\n\n4. **Tesla**\n   - **Background:** Tesla, the electric car company led by **Elon Musk**, was an early corporate adopter of Bitcoin. In 2021, it announced it would accept Bitcoin for car purchases, but later reversed the decision in 2022 due to environmental concerns.\n   - **Why It Matters:**",

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Bitcoin struggles below $71K as sentiment cools, but strong $60K support and steady institutional ETF inflows keep prices from falling sharply. With no fresh catalysts or regulatory clarity, Bitcoin consolidates between $60K–$71K, supported by mining costs and ongoing institutional demand. Bitcoin is trading just below the $71,000 level and is finding it hard to move higher as market sentiment cools. According to CNBC Senior Crypto Reporter MacKenzie Sigalos, the current price movement shows a market that is no longer driven by strong excitement but is still supported by steady demand that is preventing a sharp fall. While Bitcoin has recovered from recent lows, short-term strength remains weak, pointing to uncertainty among traders. Investors are becoming more careful with their positions, and the market is shifting from aggressive buying to a wait-and-watch phase. Instead of hype, decisions are now based on risk control and capital allocation, keeping Bitcoin price movement mostly sideways for now. One major reason for Bitcoin’s slow performance is the lack of new positive triggers. Sigalos notes that progress on crypto regulation, especially the CLARITY Act , has stalled. Many investors expected clearer rules from this bill, but with no movement in Congress, that optimism has faded. At the same time, the earlier boost in confidence linked to President Trump’s return has also cooled. Broader financial markets have shown signs of weakness, leading some large investment firms to reduce their exposure to risk assets. This cautious mood has weighed on Bitcoin, even though long-term interest in the asset remains. The “digital gold” narrative is also being debated again. Critics say Bitcoin has not fully proven itself during periods of economic stress, while supporters argue that traditional currencies lose value over time due to inflation, which keeps Bitcoin’s long-term appeal as a store of value intact. Despite the recent weakness, Bitcoin has repeatedly found buying interest near the $60,000 level. Sigalos explains that this area is close to the average cost required to mine new Bitcoin. If the price drops below this level, many mining operations would struggle to stay profitable. That would reduce selling from miners who usually sell Bitcoin to cover expenses. Because of this, the $60,000 zone is acting as a strong price floor and has helped Bitcoin recover toward the $70,000 range. This pattern reflects how production costs can influence Bitcoin price support, similar to commodities. Unlike earlier market cycles that were driven mostly by retail traders, large financial players are now playing a bigger role. Many individual traders have shifted attention to prediction platforms, while demand is being led by spot Bitcoin ETFs and companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded about $300 million in net inflows in a single day, showing that institutional demand is still present, even if investors are cautious. Discussions with ETF providers suggest interest remains steady as the market waits for clearer regulatory signals. If selling pressure increases again, Bitcoin could retest the $60,000 support level, where buyers are likely to step in. On the upside, the absence of fresh positive news means Bitcoin may continue moving within a broad $60,000 to $71,000 range in the near term. Until there is clearer regulation or stronger global market conditions, Bitcoin appears to be in a consolidation phase—supported by institutional demand, limited by uncertainty, and waiting for the next major catalyst to decide its direction. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Sideways markets can reduce volatility short term, but they also build pressure for sharper moves later. A breakout or breakdown usually follows a clear macro or policy signal. Miners, exchanges, and blockchain startups may see tighter margins and slower growth. Companies with strong balance sheets are better positioned to weather extended consolidation.

      "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried files for new trial over FTX fraud charges",
      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the FTX Collapse and Sam Bankman-Fried’s New Trial**\n\nIn early 2023, one of the biggest scandals in the history of cryptocurrency unfolded when **FTX**, a once-prominent crypto exchange, went bankrupt after a series of fraudulent activities were exposed. At the center of this collapse was **Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)**, the exchange’s founder, who was later charged with multiple counts of fraud and money laundering. Now, SBF is facing a **new trial** in a U.S. court, where he could be sentenced to decades in prison if found guilty. To understand why this case matters, let’s break down the key players, the technology involved, and what happened.\n\n---\n\n### **What Was FTX?**\n\nFTX was a **cryptocurrency exchange**—a platform where people could buy, sell, and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. It was founded in **2019** by **Sam Bankman-Fried**, a young and ambitious entrepreneur who quickly rose to fame in the crypto world. At its peak, FTX was valued at over **$32 billion**, making it one of the largest crypto companies globally. It also owned or invested in several other businesses, including **Alameda Research** (a crypto trading firm), **FTX US**, and even a political lobbying group.\n\nBut FTX wasn’t just another exchange. It was a major player in the **crypto derivatives market**, meaning it allowed traders to bet on the future price of cryptocurrencies without actually owning them. For example, if someone believed Bitcoin would rise in value, they could buy a **futures contract** (a bet) on FTX instead of purchasing Bitcoin directly. This was risky but also promised big rewards. FTX also offered **leveraged trading**, where users could borrow money to amplify their bets—something that led to many of its problems.\n\nThe company grew rapidly, partly because SBF was a **charismatic figure** who frequently spoke about crypto’s potential to replace traditional finance. He was known for his **progressive political views**, donating large sums to Democratic causes and even hiring lobbyists to influence U.S. crypto regulations. Many people trusted him, believing FTX was a safe and legitimate business.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Sam Bankman-Fried?**\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born in **1992** and raised in a wealthy family in Stanford, California. His father, **Joe Bankman-Fried**, was a professor at Stanford Law School, and his mother, **Barbara Fried**, was a professor at Harvard Law School. SBF showed an early interest in finance and mathematics, competing in high school math competitions and later studying physics at MIT before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania to earn a law degree.\n\nDespite his academic background, SBF became a **self-made crypto billionaire**. He started trading cryptocurrencies in **2017**, initially working for Jane Street Capital, a high-frequency trading firm. He then moved to the Bahamas, where he founded FTX in **2019**. The company was based in the Bahamas because crypto regulations were more relaxed there compared to the U.S., allowing FTX to operate with fewer restrictions.\n\nSBF was known for his **unconventional lifestyle**. He lived modestly, wore the same clothes for weeks, and often spoke about **effective altruism**, a philosophy that encourages people to maximize their positive impact by donating to the most cost-effective causes. He donated millions to political campaigns and charities, including groups focused on reducing global suffering and promoting animal rights.\n\nDespite his public image as a **philanthropist and crypto innovator**, SBF was also accused of **reckless behavior**, such as mixing personal funds with company money and making risky bets. His downfall began when it was revealed that FTX had **misused customer funds** to prop up Alameda Research, another company he controlled.\n\n---\n\n### **What Happened to FTX? The Fraud Scandal Explained**\n\nFTX’s collapse started in **November 2022**, when a news outlet reported that **Alameda Research**, SBF’s trading firm, had borrowed **$10 billion worth of customer funds** from FTX without proper authorization. This was a major red flag because:\n\n1. **FTX was supposed to keep customer funds safe**—like a bank holding deposits. But instead, it was lending them to Alameda, which was essentially SBF’s personal company.\n2. **Alameda was using FTX’s own token (FTT) as collateral**—FTT was a token created by FTX to encourage trading on its platform. But Alameda was borrowing money using FTT as security, which was risky because the token’s value was tied to FTX itself.\n3. **FTX’s finances were a mess**—Investors like **BlackRock** (a traditional finance giant) and **Templeton Dragon Capital** (a crypto investment firm) had given FTX billions in funding, but the company couldn’t prove it had enough assets to cover its debts. When customers tried to withdraw their money, FTX couldn’t pay them.\n\nThe situation worsened when **Binance**, another major crypto exchange, announced it was selling its **FTT holdings** (worth about **$2.1 billion**). This caused panic among FTX users, who rushed to withdraw their funds. FTX couldn’t handle the withdrawals, leading to a **bank run**—where many customers lost access to their money.\n\nWithin days, FTX filed for **bankruptcy**, and regulators seized its assets. The U.S. government accused SBF of **fraud, money laundering, and failing to protect customer funds**. He",

Since being convicted and imprisoned on a 25-year sentence, SBF has been continually challenging his situation in court. The latest motion for a new trial, first reported on Tuesday by Inner City Press , was filed by his mother, Barbara Fried, claiming new evidence in the case would justify a reset. The filing noted the initial absence of testimony from figures, including FTX's Ryan Salame, who fought his own, separate legal battle. The former FTX executive, Salame, was also convicted on federal charges but had claimed he made an arrangement to cooperate with prosecutors that should have protected his wife, Michelle Bond, from legal pursuit. She was later charged with allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions in her congressional bid. SBF's 35-page document arrived at the court as a pro se request , meaning the defendant is representing himself. Earlier efforts by SBF to argue he didn't get a fair initial trial — which came to a head in November — were met with some skepticism by appellate judges. SBF's defense in seeking a retrial through appeal focused attention on the later solvency of FTX, and his account on the social media site X continues to make the argument that the company wasn't bankrupt when it collapsed. However, judges contended in November that solvency didn't seem to be the primary issue. \"Part of the government's theory of the case is that the defendant misrepresented to investors that their money was safe, was not being used in the way that it was the government claims and the jury convicted it was, in fact, used,\" said Circuit Judge Maria Araújo Kahn, referring to the misappropriation of customer money at the heart of his conviction. Shutting down another potential path to freedom, President Donald Trump recently said he wouldn't consider clemency for SBF. However, the former FTX CEO is still campaigning for himself via his account on X , arguing he's a victim of former President Joe Biden's \"lawfare machine.\" Blockchain.com wins UK registration nearly four years after abandoning FCA process The London-based company elected to withdraw its application for FCA licensing in March 2022 having not won approval ahead of an impending deadline."

      "title": "Concerns over Strategy selling bitcoin are 'unfounded,' Michael Saylor says",
      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Article: Michael Saylor Defends Strategy’s Bitcoin Sales**\n\nIn late 2023, a crypto news article caught the attention of many investors and observers when **Michael Saylor**, the CEO of **MicroStrategy (MSTR)**, publicly dismissed concerns about **Strategy**, a company he founded, selling some of its **Bitcoin (BTC)** holdings. The article, titled *\"Concerns over Strategy selling bitcoin are 'unfounded,' Michael Saylor says,\"* explores why Saylor believes these worries are overblown and what the situation actually means for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nTo break this down in simple terms, we’ll first explain who **Michael Saylor** and **MicroStrategy** are, what **Strategy** is, and what **Bitcoin** is. Then, we’ll discuss why some people were worried about Strategy selling Bitcoin, what Saylor’s response means, and whether this situation is truly harmless—or if there are deeper implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Who is Michael Saylor?**\n\nMichael Saylor is a businessman and entrepreneur best known for leading **MicroStrategy**, a publicly traded company that specializes in **business intelligence software**. This means MicroStrategy helps organizations analyze large amounts of data to make better decisions. Before crypto, Saylor was a software executive in the 1990s and 2000s, playing a key role in the growth of companies like **Bullhorn** and **Blackboard**.\n\nSaylor’s connection to Bitcoin began in **2020**, when he famously argued that Bitcoin was the **\"world’s best collaboration system\"**—a way for people to store and transfer value without relying on governments or banks. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around **$10,000**, and Saylor convinced MicroStrategy to start buying it as a corporate treasury asset (a long-term investment). This was unusual because most companies held cash or traditional assets like stocks and bonds, not cryptocurrency.\n\nBy **2022**, MicroStrategy had accumulated **over 170,000 BTC**, worth roughly **$6 billion** at Bitcoin’s peak. This made the company one of the biggest institutional holders of Bitcoin, alongside firms like **Tesla** (which briefly held BTC in 2021) and **Block** (formerly Square). Saylor became a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a **\"hard money\"** alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies (like the U.S. dollar), and he often shared his bullish views on social media.\n\nIn **2023**, Saylor stepped down as MicroStrategy’s CEO but remained on the board. Around the same time, he announced the creation of **Strategy**, a new company focused on Bitcoin-related investments, research, and financial products. Unlike MicroStrategy, which is a software company that happens to hold Bitcoin, Strategy is a **Bitcoin-native firm**, meaning its primary business is centered around crypto.\n\n---\n\n### **What is MicroStrategy, and Why Does It Hold Bitcoin?**\n\nMicroStrategy is a **public company**, meaning its shares are traded on the stock market. Normally, companies keep cash reserves, gold, or other investments to protect their value. However, in 2020, Saylor proposed that MicroStrategy should instead hold **Bitcoin** as its main treasury asset.\n\nHis reasoning was that Bitcoin is **scarce** (only 21 million will ever exist), **decentralized** (no single entity controls it), and **resistant to inflation** (unlike paper money, which governments can print endlessly). Saylor believed that Bitcoin would appreciate in value over time, just like gold or other hard assets, but without the storage or liquidity problems associated with physical gold.\n\nAt first, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases were controversial. Critics argued that holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin was risky, especially for a company whose revenue depends on software sales. However, as Bitcoin’s price rose, MicroStrategy’s strategy seemed to pay off—its Bitcoin holdings grew from **$250 million** in 2020 to **over $6 billion** in 2022.\n\nWhen Bitcoin’s price crashed in **2022**, MicroStrategy’s financial health came under scrutiny. The company had taken on debt to buy Bitcoin, and as the price dropped, its balance sheet looked shaky. Some investors worried that MicroStrategy might have to sell Bitcoin to cover expenses, which could hurt the market. However, the company survived by **issuing more shares** and **securing a $650 million line of credit** from **Silvergate Capital**, a now-defunct crypto-friendly bank.\n\nDespite the challenges, MicroStrategy continued to hold Bitcoin, and Saylor remained convinced that it was a sound long-term investment. His departure from the CEO role in 2023 did not change MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, though it did lead to some shifts in leadership and corporate focus.\n\n---\n\n### **What is Strategy, and What Does It Do?**\n\nIn **2023**, Michael Saylor founded **Strategy**, a company designed to operate in the **Bitcoin ecosystem**. Unlike MicroStrategy, which is a business intelligence firm that uses Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Strategy is a **Bitcoin investment company**.\n\nThe company’s primary goal is to **acquire, hold, and manage Bitcoin** on behalf of its investors. Strategy also conducts **research** on Bitcoin’s adoption, technology, and financial implications, and it may develop **financial products** (like Bitcoin-backed loans or structured investment vehicles) to help other institutions and individuals gain exposure to the asset.\n\nOne of Strategy’s key moves was **buying Bitcoin from MicroStrategy** at a **discount**. In **November 2023**, MicroStrategy announced it would sell **10",
      "full_text": "Concerns that Strategy (MSTR) will be forced to sell bitcoin BTC $ 68,755.64 amid falling prices are “an unfounded concern,” chairman Michael Saylor said during a CNBC interview, affirming the company’s commitment to ongoing purchases. “Our net leverage ratio is half the typical investment grade company,\" Saylor said. \"We've got 50 years worth of dividends and bitcoin, we've got two and a half years worth of dividends just in cash on our balance sheet ... we're not going to be selling, we're going to be buying bitcoin. I expect we'll be buying bitcoin every quarter forever.” Last week , the company added 1,142 BTC to its holdings for roughly $90 million, at an average price of $78,815 per coin. The company’s total stack now stands at 714,644 coins, purchased for about $54.35 billion, bringing the average cost per bitcoin to $76,056 — well above the current price of around $69,000. Saylor’s comments come as bitcoin has seen significant volatility (almost exclusively downward) over the past months, though he emphasized that swings are part of the asset’s design. “The key to keep in mind is that bitcoin is digital capital,\" he continued. \"It's going to be two to four times as volatile as traditional capital like gold or equity or real estate. It's got two to four times the performance this decade of traditional capital. It's the most useful global capital asset in the world, you can put more leverage on it. You can trade it in more ways than any other kind of capital assets. So the volatility is the bug, but the volatility is the feature.\" Strategy reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion and a net loss of $12.6 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting largely non-cash mark-to-market accounting tied to bitcoin’s price decline. The results highlight how swings in the cryptocurrency’s value continue to influence the company’s financial statements despite its long-term investment strategy. Saylor also addressed the notion that bitcoin’s current price levels could represent a new form of market maturity, which he characterized as a good thing. Strategy’s balance sheet and its digital credit business are central to its strategy, Saylor said. The firm’s digital credit structure has emerged as one of the most actively traded credit instruments of the decade, generating substantially higher cash flow than traditional fixed-income products and far exceeding the trading volume of preferred stocks. “There isn’t any credit risk in the balance sheet of the company,” he said. Saylor declined to offer a short-term bitcoin price prediction but reiterated confidence in long-term performance. “I don't really make predictions over 12 months. I think that bitcoin is going to double or triple the performance of the S&P over the next four to eight years. And I think that's the only thing we need to know.” Shares of the company are down 3% on Tuesday, bringing the year-to-date decline to 15% and the year-over-year fall to 60%. Struggling Coinbase gets price target cut from JPMorgan ahead of Thursday earnings Shares of COIN are down nearly 30% this year, with analysts warning that softer trading and crypto prices are likely to weigh on revenue."

      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Tether Invests in LayerZero Labs: A Simple Explanation of the News**\n\nIn late 2023, **Tether**, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin **USDT**, announced that it was investing in **LayerZero Labs**, a startup working on **cross-chain technology**—a way for different blockchain networks to communicate and share data with each other. This move is part of Tether’s broader strategy to support **agentic finance**, a concept that combines traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi) by using AI-driven, automated systems to manage financial transactions.\n\nTo understand why this matters, let’s break down the key terms, the companies involved, and what this investment means for the future of blockchain and finance.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Tether (USDT)?**\n\nTether is a **stablecoin**, a type of cryptocurrency designed to keep its value stable by being pegged (or tied) to a real-world asset, usually the **U.S. dollar**. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing in price dramatically, USDT is meant to stay at **$1 per token**. This makes it useful for trading, payments, and storing value without worrying about price fluctuations.\n\nTether was created in **2014** by **Brooks Britton** and **Cristian Stone**, but it gained widespread attention in **2017** when it launched USDT as a way to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat (traditional) money. The company claims that each USDT is backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars in reserves, though this has been a subject of debate due to Tether’s lack of full transparency in the past.\n\nToday, Tether is one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, with **over $100 billion in circulation** (as of early 2024). It is widely used on exchanges like **Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex** to facilitate trading without needing to convert between cryptocurrencies and dollars every time. However, Tether has faced criticism for its **centralized structure**—meaning it is controlled by a single company rather than being fully decentralized like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nDespite these concerns, Tether remains a major player in crypto, and its investment in LayerZero Labs suggests it is looking to expand its influence beyond just stablecoins.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is LayerZero Labs?**\n\nLayerZero Labs is a **blockchain technology company** focused on **cross-chain interoperability**, which means allowing different blockchains to work together seamlessly. Before LayerZero, most cryptocurrencies operated in **isolated ecosystems**. For example, Bitcoin could not directly interact with Ethereum, or a token on Solana could not be used on Avalanche. This limitation made it difficult to move assets, data, or smart contract functions between chains.\n\nLayerZero’s solution is a **protocol** (a set of rules) that enables **cross-chain communication** without relying on a single centralized authority. Instead, it uses **automated systems** and **decentralized infrastructure** to connect blockchains. The company’s flagship product, **LayerZero**, acts like a \"router\" for blockchain networks, allowing transactions to happen between them efficiently.\n\nOne of LayerZero’s key innovations is its use of **\"endpoints\"**—small pieces of code deployed on different blockchains that act as bridges. When a user wants to send an asset from one chain to another, the endpoint verifies the transaction and relays it to the destination chain. This avoids the need for a **centralized intermediary** (like a bank or a single company) and reduces delays and costs.\n\nLayerZero also supports **\"agentic finance\"**, a term that refers to **AI-driven financial systems** operating on decentralized networks. These systems can automatically execute trades, manage risk, and optimize liquidity without human intervention. By investing in LayerZero, Tether is positioning itself to be part of this emerging field.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Cross-Chain Technology?**\n\nCross-chain technology is a way for **different blockchains** to **talk to each other**. Since most blockchains (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.) are **independent**, they cannot directly transfer assets or data between themselves. For example, if you have **Ethereum (ETH)** and want to use it on the **Polygon network**, you usually need to **lock it in a smart contract** on Ethereum and then **mint a wrapped version (like WETH)** on Polygon.\n\nBefore cross-chain solutions, this process was **slow, expensive, and complex**. Users had to rely on **centralized exchanges** (like Binance or Coinbase) or **decentralized bridges** (like Chainlink’s CCIP or Polygon’s PoS bridge) to move assets between chains. Some of these bridges have been **hacked**, leading to millions in losses.\n\nLayerZero’s approach is **decentralized and permissionless**, meaning anyone can use it without needing approval from a central authority. It achieves this by:\n\n1. **Using Endpoints** – Small programs on each blockchain that verify and relay messages.\n2. **Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** – A cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove to another that a transaction is valid **without revealing the details**. This helps secure cross-chain transfers.\n3. **Being Gasless (or Low-Gas)** – Unlike many bridges that require users to pay fees on both chains, LayerZero minimizes costs by using efficient messaging methods.\n\nThis technology is important because it could **reduce fragmentation** in the blockchain space. Right now, there are **hundreds of blockchains**, each with its",
      "full_text": "Tether Investments, the investment arm of the leading stablecoin issuer, has made a strategic investment in LayerZero Labs, which develops an interoperability protocol called LayerZero. The move is essentially a bet on the technology underpinning USDt0, a blockchain-agnostic version of Tether’s dollar-pegged token that has moved over $70 billion across blockchains in less than a year, according to a press release the company shared. LayerZero’s infrastructure enables cryptocurrencies to flow across different blockchains without fragmentation or illiquidity. That allows developers building financial tools to rely on stablecoins without getting their funds locked in a single network. That same architecture also supports more experimental use cases, like AI agents managing their own wallets and sending payments autonomously, in what Tether called “agentic finance.” Tether’s investment comes on the heels of USDt0’s deployment by Everdawn Labs and is built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. Alongside their tokenized Tether gold token, XAUt0, the projects are seen as real-world tests of LayerZero’s interoperability framework. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Tether did not reply to a request for comment. The stablecoin giant has been using the billions it generates from backing USDT tokens in circulation to make a wide range of investments. These include a majority stake in Latin American agricultural firm Adecoagro (AGRO), a privacy-focused health app , and a stake in video-sharing platform Rumble (RUM). The company has been aggressively accumulating gold , and earlier this month, itbought a $150 million stake in Gold.com to boost the distribution of tokenized gold. LayerZero’s ZRO token gained as much as 10% on the news, but quickly reversed, now lower by 3% over the past 24 hours.

      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Bitcoin News: Why the U.S. Jobs Report Matters for the $70,000 Price Range**\n\nIn recent days, Bitcoin—the world’s most popular cryptocurrency—has been trading around **$70,000**, moving within a narrow range (meaning its price isn’t rising or falling much). This stability comes ahead of a major economic event: the **U.S. jobs report**, which will be released on Wednesday. For beginners, this might sound confusing—why does a report about jobs in the U.S. affect Bitcoin’s price? To answer that, we need to break down a few key concepts: **what Bitcoin is, how it works, what the U.S. jobs report means, and why financial markets (including crypto) react to it**.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin? A Quick Overview**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a **digital currency** that operates without a central bank or government. Instead, it relies on a decentralized system called **blockchain**, which is a public ledger recording all transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional money (like dollars or euros), Bitcoin isn’t physical—it exists only as entries on this digital ledger.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates based on **supply and demand**, just like stocks or gold. When more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price goes up. When more people sell than buy, the price drops. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively new and speculative asset, its price can be highly sensitive to news, economic trends, and investor sentiment.\n\nSome key players in Bitcoin’s ecosystem include:\n- **Investors and traders** – People who buy Bitcoin hoping its value will rise (or sell to profit from price increases).\n- **Institutions (like MicroStrategy, Tesla, or BlackRock)** – Large companies or funds that hold Bitcoin as part of their assets.\n- **Governments and regulators** – Entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that can influence crypto markets through laws and policies.\n- **Miners** – Companies and individuals who use powerful computers to solve complex math problems, helping secure the Bitcoin network and earn new coins as rewards.\n- **Exchanges (like Coinbase or Binance)** – Platforms where people trade Bitcoin for other currencies or assets.\n\nBitcoin’s price has seen massive swings over its history—from near **zero in 2010** to **$69,000 in late 2023**, with highs above **$60,000 in 2021** and lows below **$16,000 in 2022**. These changes often reflect broader economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates, and market confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Is Bitcoin Stuck Around $70,000?**\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is trading in a **tight range**, meaning it’s neither making big gains nor losses. This happens for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Market Uncertainty** – Investors are waiting for major news to decide whether to buy or sell. If the market is unsure about future trends, prices can stall.\n2. **Institutional Caution** – Big investors (like hedge funds or corporations) may be holding off on making large moves until they see clearer signals. Some have been buying Bitcoin in recent months, but others are still waiting to see if the price will rise further before adding more.\n3. **Technical Factors** – Bitcoin’s price is influenced by **support and resistance levels**—points where traders expect the price to either stop falling (support) or stop rising (resistance). $70,000 might be acting as a **resistance level**, meaning many traders are selling just below it, preventing the price from climbing higher.\n4. **Macroeconomic Events** – The **U.S. jobs report** is one of the most closely watched economic indicators. It gives clues about whether the economy is strong or weakening, which can affect Bitcoin’s price.\n\nSince Bitcoin is still a **high-risk, high-reward asset**, many traders treat it like a **speculative investment**—similar to stocks or commodities. If the jobs report shows a **strong economy**, some investors might see Bitcoin as a safe bet (because a strong economy often leads to higher stock and asset prices). If the report is **weak**, they might pull back, fearing that the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) could **cut interest rates**, which historically has made Bitcoin less attractive.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the U.S. Jobs Report?**\n\nThe **U.S. jobs report**, officially called the **Employment Situation Summary**, is a monthly report released by the **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**, a government agency that tracks labor market trends. It includes key numbers like:\n\n- **Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP)** – The total number of jobs added in the U.S. (excluding farming, government, and private household jobs).\n- **Unemployment Rate** – The percentage of people without jobs but actively looking for work.\n- **Average Hourly Earnings** – How much workers are making per hour, which helps predict inflation.\n- **Labor Force Participation Rate** – The percentage of working-age people either employed or looking for jobs.\n\nThis report is crucial because it helps the **Federal Reserve (the Fed)** decide whether to **raise or lower interest rates**. Interest rates affect borrowing costs, which in turn influence spending, investment, and even Bitcoin’s price.\n\n#### **Why Does the Fed Care About Jobs?**\nThe Fed’s main goal is to keep the U.S. economy stable. One way it does this is by controlling **inflation** (rising prices) and **unemployment** (people without",
      "full_text": "Following the usual recent pattern, crypto markets fell sharply as U.S. stocks opened for trade Tuesday, but recovered most of those losses in a similarly quick fashion. In mid-morning trade, bitcoin BTC $ 68,755.64 was at $69,200, down marginally from 24 hours ago. Ether ETH $ 2,008.42 underperformed, down 1.8%, with similar declines in XRP XRP $ 1.4017 and Solana SOL $ 82.77 . While bitcoin's current drawdown is the most significant since the 2024 halving, trading volume stayed low during the decline, suggesting retail investors stepped back rather than rushed to sell, according to Kaiko. The \"market [is now] approaching critical technical support levels that will determine whether the four-year cycle framework remains intact,\" Kaiko research analyst Laurens Fraussen wrote in a report Tuesday. Trading firm Wintermute expects bitcoin to remain in the current range as it's still in price discovery. Recent bitcoin moves have been driven by leveraged derivatives rather than spot demand, the firm said, with light spot volumes leaving prices sensitive to crowded positions. Wintermute pointed to last Friday’s rebound as a short squeeze in perpetual futures and said the return of volatility caught investors off guard after a period of complacency. Originally scheduled for last Friday, the government’s January Nonfarm Payrolls Report is now coming out on Wednesday morning due to the brief federal shutdown last month. Economist forecasts are for 70,000 jobs to have been added, up from 50,000 in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.4%. White House trade counselor Peter Navarro, however, said in a Fox interview Tuesday that expectations need to be significantly revised lower. His comments follow those of White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, who advised markets not to panic on weak jobs data. Those remarks appear to have been noted by the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield is lower by 5 basis points to 4.14%. Lower interest rates and easier Federal Reserve monetary policy are typically assumed to be good for assets like bitcoin, but it hasn’t been the case this cycle, with bitcoin plunging even as the Fed has trimmed rates by 75 basis points in recent months. Concerns over Strategy selling bitcoin are 'unfounded,' Michael Saylor says Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor affirmed the firm’s commitment to a long-term bitcoin strategy following major fourth quarter losses and a continued plunge in prices early this year."

      "title": "Crypto exchange Kraken fires chief financial officer ahead of long-awaited IPO",
      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Kraken Fires Its Chief Financial Officer Before a Potential IPO: What You Need to Know**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, an **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** is a big deal. It means a company is transitioning from being privately owned—where shares are held by a small group of investors—to being publicly traded on a stock exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. When a company goes public, anyone can buy its shares, and its value is determined by the stock market rather than a handful of venture capitalists. For cryptocurrency firms, an IPO is also a way to gain legitimacy, attract traditional investors, and raise money for growth.\n\nOne of the companies that has been preparing for an IPO is **Kraken**, a major **crypto exchange** (a platform where people buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others). Kraken was founded in **2011** by **Jesse Powell**, a former employee of the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange **Mt. Gox**. Powell created Kraken as an alternative after Mt. Gox collapsed in a massive hack, leading to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Over the years, Kraken has grown into one of the largest and most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, serving millions of users worldwide.\n\nIn late **2023**, Kraken announced that it was **firing its Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Michael Gronager**, just weeks before its highly anticipated IPO. This move surprised many in the crypto industry, as a CFO is a key executive responsible for managing a company’s financial health, reporting to regulators, and ensuring transparency—all critical factors when a company prepares to go public. Gronager had been with Kraken since **2018**, helping the company navigate financial challenges, including **regulatory scrutiny** (government oversight) and **audits** (examinations of a company’s financial records).\n\n#### **What Is Kraken?**\nKraken is a **digital asset exchange**, meaning it allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, as well as other digital assets like **stablecoins** (cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar) and **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**. Unlike traditional stock exchanges, which only deal in stocks and bonds, Kraken specializes in crypto trading.\n\nThe company operates in multiple countries, including the **U.S.**, **Canada**, **Europe**, and **Australia**, and has a strong reputation for security. It holds most of its users’ funds in **cold storage** (offline wallets that are less vulnerable to hacking) and has never suffered a major security breach. Kraken also offers **staking services**, where users can lock up their crypto to support blockchain networks (like Ethereum or Solana) in exchange for rewards.\n\nBeyond trading, Kraken provides **financial products** like futures contracts (bets on the future price of crypto) and **margin trading** (borrowing money to trade, which can be risky). It also has a **crypto lending program**, where users can earn interest by lending their digital assets to the platform.\n\nKraken is known for being **user-friendly**, with features like low trading fees, a simple interface, and strong customer support. However, it has faced criticism over the years for **slow transaction speeds** and **limited customer options** (such as not offering direct fiat-to-crypto purchases in all regions). Still, it remains one of the most established exchanges in the industry.\n\n#### **Who Is Michael Gronager?**\nMichael Gronager was Kraken’s **CFO**, a role that involves overseeing the company’s finances, including revenue, expenses, accounting, and compliance with laws. Before joining Kraken, Gronager worked at **Danish investment banks** like **Danske Bank** and **Jyske Bank**, where he gained experience in financial reporting and risk management.\n\nIn **2021**, Kraken faced a major **regulatory issue** when the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** accused it of operating an **unregistered securities exchange** and **defrauding investors**. The SEC claimed that Kraken was allowing users to trade **unregistered crypto assets** (like certain tokens that may qualify as securities under U.S. law) without proper oversight. Gronager played a key role in Kraken’s defense, working with lawyers and regulators to address the charges.\n\nThe case was eventually **settled in 2023**, with Kraken paying a **$30 million fine** and agreeing to stop offering certain services to U.S. customers. While the settlement was a relief, it also meant Kraken had to **restructure its business** and focus on compliance—a major task for a CFO.\n\n#### **Why Was Gronager Fired?**\nThe exact reason for Gronager’s dismissal is not entirely clear, but there are a few possibilities based on industry reports and statements from Kraken:\n\n1. **Regulatory Pressure and Compliance Costs** – The SEC settlement required Kraken to change how it operates in the U.S., which could have led to financial losses or complications. A CFO might be held accountable if a company’s financial performance doesn’t meet expectations, especially before an IPO.\n\n2. **Leadership Changes** – Kraken has been undergoing **major restructuring** in recent years. In **2022**, the company **laid off about 30% of its workforce** (around **1,100 employees**) due to a **decline in crypto prices** and **changing market conditions**. The CEO, **Dave Ripley**, had also been under pressure",

Robert Moore, formerly VP of business expansion, has basically taken over her job, the person said. An updated leadership page on the website of Kraken’s parent company, Payward Inc., lists Moore as deputy CFO. Lemmerman does not appear. Clearly it matters that Kraken has removed its CFO after lodging a confidential filing with U.S. regulators in November. That came just days after Kraken raised $800 million at a $20 billion valuation, including $200 million from Citadel Securities. Other people who have been promoted to senior roles include Curtis Ting, who was made chief operating officer in December, and Kamo Asatryan was made chief data officer in January.

Ethereum’s decentralized nature might offer solutions to some of these problems.\n\nBefore diving into Buterin’s proposal, it’s important to understand what **Ethereum** and **AI** are, as well as why they might be connected.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Ethereum?**\n\nEthereum is a **blockchain platform**—a digital system that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed mostly as a form of money, Ethereum was built to support **smart contracts**: self-executing agreements written in code that run automatically when certain conditions are met.\n\nFor example, if two people agree to a contract where Person A pays Person B $10 if a specific event happens (like a temperature rising above 30°C), Ethereum’s blockchain can verify that event and release the payment without needing a middleman like a bank or lawyer. This makes Ethereum useful for many applications beyond just cryptocurrency, such as **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, and now, potentially, **AI**.\n\nEthereum’s native cryptocurrency is called **Ether (ETH)**, which is used to pay for transactions and computational power on the network. The platform also allows developers to create their own tokens and build decentralized apps (dApps) on top of it.\n\nOne of the key features of Ethereum is its **decentralization**. Instead of being controlled by a single company or government, Ethereum runs on thousands of computers worldwide, making it harder to manipulate or censor. This is why some people see it as a way to improve AI—by removing central control from powerful AI systems.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to **computer systems that can perform tasks usually requiring human intelligence**, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and recognizing patterns. AI has been around for decades, but recent advances—especially in **machine learning** (a type of AI that improves over time by analyzing data)—have made it much more powerful and widely used.\n\nToday, most AI systems rely on **centralized models** trained by big companies like **Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI**. These companies collect vast amounts of data, use it to train AI, and then deploy the models for various applications, such as chatbots, image generation, or recommendation systems.\n\nHowever, this centralized approach has some problems:\n- **Data privacy concerns**: Companies like Google and Meta have faced criticism for how they handle user data. If AI is trained on private information, who controls it?\n- **Bias and fairness**: AI trained on biased data can produce unfair or discriminatory results. Centralized control means a few organizations decide what data is used, which can lead to skewed outcomes.\n- **Single points of failure**: If one company decides to shut down or change an AI model, users may lose access to it. Decentralization could prevent this.\n\nButerin suggests that Ethereum’s blockchain could help solve these issues by making AI systems **more open, transparent, and controlled by users rather than corporations**.\n\n---\n\n### **How Could Ethereum Be Used in AI?**\n\nButerin’s idea revolves around **decentralized AI (decentralized AI or \"decentralized machine learning\")**, where AI models and their training data are stored and managed on a blockchain instead of by a single company.\n\nHere’s how it might work:\n\n#### **1. Decentralized Training of AI Models**\nCurrently, AI models are trained on **massive datasets** owned by companies like Google or Amazon. Buterin proposes that instead of one company controlling all the data, many people could contribute their data to an AI model in exchange for **tokens or rewards**.\n\nFor example, if you have a dataset of medical records, you could share parts of it with an AI system—but only if you’re compensated. Ethereum’s blockchain could track who contributed what data and ensure they get paid fairly. This way, AI models could become **more accurate and less biased** because they’d rely on a wider variety of data sources.\n\n#### **2. AI as a Service on Ethereum**\nButerin also suggests that AI could be treated like a **decentralized service**, similar to how Ethereum allows developers to build apps without relying on a single server.\n\nImagine an AI model that runs on Ethereum’s blockchain. Instead of being hosted by one company (like OpenAI’s GPT-4), it would be **split across many nodes** (computers maintaining the blockchain). Users could interact with the AI by paying in Ether, and the model’s responses would be verified by the network.\n\nThis could make AI **more resistant to censorship**—if one node or company tries to block access, others could still keep the system running.\n\n#### **3. Incentivizing AI Development with Tokens**\nButerin believes that **token-based rewards** could encourage more people to develop and improve AI models. Instead of working for a single company (like a Google engineer), independent developers could build AI tools, publish them on Ethereum, and earn tokens when people use their models.\n\nThis would create a **marketplace for AI**,",
      "full_text": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called for a rethink of how crypto and AI should come together, warning that a growing focus on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) risks missing the bigger picture. In a post on X that revisits ideas he first outlined two years ago , Buterin argues that the accelerated push toward artificial general intelligence often resembles the kind of unchecked speed and scale that Ethereum itself was created to challenge. Rather than racing to build more powerful AI systems, he says the goal should be to guide AI development in a way that protects human freedom, spreads power more evenly and avoids both extreme AI risks and everyday security failures. Buterin outlines a near-term vision where Ethereum plays an important — though not exclusive — role as infrastructure for AI. That includes tools to allow people to interact with AI models more privately, reducing the need to trust centralized providers. For example, running models locally, making anonymous payments for AI services and using cryptography to verify how AI systems behave. He also describes Ethereum as a way for AI systems to coordinate economically, allowing bots to pay other bots, post security deposits, build reputations and resolve disputes without relying on a single company. Paired with AI tools that help people evaluate decisions and outcomes, Buterin argues these systems could make long-discussed ideas like decentralized governance work at real-world scale. “To me, Ethereum, and my own view of how our civilization should do AGI, are precisely about choosing a positive direction rather than embracing undifferentiated acceleration of the arrow,” Buterin wrote on X.

      "source": "CoinDesk",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the CoinDesk 20 Performance Update: A Simple Explanation**\n\nIn late 2021, the financial news website **CoinDesk** launched a new product called the **CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index**. This index tracks the performance of the **top 20 most liquid cryptocurrencies** by market capitalization—meaning the coins that are easiest to buy and sell in large amounts. The index was created to give investors a broader view of the crypto market beyond just Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are the two largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. However, in its latest update, the CoinDesk 20 Index fell by **3.4%**, meaning all 20 of the coins in the index dropped in value at the same time.\n\nThis news might sound confusing if you’re new to cryptocurrencies, so let’s break it down step by step: what the CoinDesk 20 Index is, which coins and companies are involved, what the technology means, why this drop happened, and what it could imply for the future of crypto.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the CoinDesk 20 Index?**\n\nThe **CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index** is like a stock market index (such as the S&P 500 or Dow Jones), but instead of tracking traditional stocks, it follows **20 major cryptocurrencies**. These coins are selected based on their **liquidity**—how easily they can be traded without affecting their price. Liquidity is important because if a coin is hard to sell quickly, its price can swing wildly, making it riskier for investors.\n\nCoinDesk, which has been around since **2013**, is a well-known media company that reports on **Bitcoin, blockchain, and digital assets**. It provides news, analysis, and data for crypto traders, developers, and businesses. The CoinDesk 20 Index was introduced as a way to measure the overall health of the crypto market by looking at a mix of the biggest and most stable coins rather than just one or two.\n\nBefore the CD20, the most famous crypto index was the **Bitcoin Dominance Index**, which shows how much of the total crypto market is made up of Bitcoin compared to other coins. But since Bitcoin often moves differently from smaller cryptocurrencies, the CD20 gives a more balanced picture.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Cryptocurrencies Are in the CoinDesk 20 Index?**\n\nThe **CoinDesk 20 Index** includes some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, such as:\n\n1. **Bitcoin (BTC)** – The first and largest cryptocurrency, created in **2009** by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Bitcoin runs on a technology called **blockchain**, which is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across many computers. It was designed as a peer-to-peer digital cash system but is now often seen as \"digital gold\"—a store of value like gold or stocks.\n2. **Ethereum (ETH)** – The second-largest crypto, launched in **2015** by **Vitalik Buterin**, a Russian-Canadian programmer. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was built to support **smart contracts**—self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain. This makes it useful for decentralized apps (dApps), financial products (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n3. **Binance Coin (BNB)** – Created by **Binance**, the world’s largest **cryptocurrency exchange** (a platform where people buy and sell digital assets). Binance was founded in **2017** by **Changpeng Zhao (CZ)**, a former blockchain developer. BNB was originally used to pay fees on Binance’s platform but has since expanded to other uses, including staking (earning rewards by holding the coin) and even powering a blockchain-based version of Binance called **Binance Smart Chain**.\n4. **Solana (SOL)** – A high-speed blockchain launched in **2020** by **Solana Labs**, a company co-founded by **Anatoly Yakovenko**, a former engineer at Qualcomm. Solana is known for its fast and cheap transactions, making it popular for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT projects. However, it has faced criticism due to occasional network outages.\n5. **Cardano (ADA)** – Another blockchain platform, created by a team led by **Charles Hoskinson**, a co-founder of Ethereum. Cardano launched in **2017** with a focus on **scalability** (handling many transactions efficiently) and **sustainability** (using less energy than Bitcoin or Ethereum). It uses a different programming language than most blockchains, which its developers claim makes it more secure.\n6. **XRP (XRP)** – Created by **Ripple Labs** in **2012** and led by **Brad Garlinghouse**, its CEO. XRP is designed to facilitate **cross-border payments** (like sending money internationally) quickly and at low cost. It has been controversial because some see it as more centralized than other cryptocurrencies.\n7. **Dogecoin (DOGE)** – Originally created as a joke in **2013** by **Billy Markus** (a software engineer) and **Jackson Palmer** (a marketer), Dogecoin was based on the **Doge meme** (a popular internet image of a Shiba Inu dog).

      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "Here’s a simple, educational breakdown of the news article **\"Bybit becomes the title partner of Stockholm Open\"** in plain language, written for a beginner with no marketing tone:\n\n---\n\n### **What Does It Mean for Bybit to Become the Title Partner of the Stockholm Open?**\n\nIn late 2023, a major cryptocurrency exchange called **Bybit** announced a partnership with the **Stockholm Open**, a prestigious tennis tournament held in Sweden. The deal makes Bybit the \"title sponsor\" of the event, meaning the company’s name will now appear in the tournament’s official title (e.g., \"Bybit Stockholm Open\" instead of just \"Stockholm Open\"). This move is part of a broader trend where crypto firms are entering traditional sports sponsorships to gain visibility and credibility.\n\nTo understand why this matters, let’s break down the key elements: **Bybit**, the **Stockholm Open**, and the implications of this kind of sponsorship.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Bybit?**\n\nBybit is a **cryptocurrency exchange**, a platform where people buy, sell, and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens. Exchanges are like online marketplaces for crypto, where users can exchange fiat money (like dollars or euros) for cryptocurrencies or trade between different digital assets.\n\nBybit was founded in **2018** by **Benjamin Zhou**, a former employee of the Wall Street firm **Jane Street Capital**, and **Zhao Xu**, a veteran of the crypto industry who had worked at exchanges like **Bitfinex** and **OKEx**. The company quickly grew, offering low trading fees and advanced features like **perpetual futures contracts** (a type of leveraged trading that allows users to bet on the future price of crypto without owning the asset).\n\nBybit operates globally but has faced regulatory challenges in some countries, including **bans in the U.S.** and **restrictions in the UK** due to concerns about financial regulations. Despite this, it remains one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, with millions of users worldwide.\n\nThe exchange also provides **Bybit Learn & Earn**, a program where users can earn crypto by completing educational courses, and **Bybit Ventures**, an investment arm that backs startups in the blockchain space. However, its primary business is still trading.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the Stockholm Open?**\n\nThe **Stockholm Open** is an annual **ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) 250** tournament, meaning it’s a mid-tier professional event on the men’s tennis circuit. The ATP ranks tournaments by prize money and prestige, with the **ATP 250** being the third-highest category after the **Grand Slams** (like Wimbledon) and **ATP 500/Masters 1000** events.\n\nThe tournament was first held in **1969** and is part of the **ATP World Tour**, the official schedule of men’s professional tennis. It takes place in **October** at the **Stockholm Arena**, a modern indoor stadium in Sweden. The event features top-ranked players and offers a **$1.4 million prize pool** (as of 2023), making it financially significant in the tennis world.\n\nThe Stockholm Open is known for its **fast indoor hard courts**, which favor players with strong serves and net games. Past winners include **Roger Federer** (who won it multiple times), **Novak Djokovic**, **Rafael Nadal**, and **Carlos Alcaraz**. The tournament is also part of the **ATP Finals**, where the top eight players in the world compete in a season-ending championship.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Are Crypto Companies Sponsoring Tennis Tournaments?**\n\nThis isn’t the first time a crypto company has sponsored a major sports event. In recent years, firms like **Binance** (a rival exchange), **FTX** (now defunct), and **Coinbase** have partnered with **Formula 1, esports, and even the NFL**. There are a few reasons why crypto companies are doing this:\n\n1. **Brand Awareness** – Traditional sports have massive audiences. By associating with a tournament like the Stockholm Open, Bybit can introduce itself to millions of people who might not otherwise know about cryptocurrency exchanges. Tennis, in particular, has a **global fanbase**, including wealthy individuals who are often early adopters of new financial technologies.\n\n2. **Legitimacy** – The crypto industry is still relatively new and sometimes seen as risky or speculative. Sponsoring a well-established event like the Stockholm Open helps Bybit **position itself as a serious, mainstream player** rather than just another speculative trading platform. It signals that the company is here to stay and is accepted in traditional financial spaces.\n\n3. **Regulatory Challenges** – Many crypto firms, including Bybit, have struggled with **government regulations** in places like the U.S., Europe, and Asia. By partnering with a regulated sports event (tennis is governed by strict rules in Sweden), Bybit can indirectly **showcase compliance** and suggest that it operates responsibly. This can help in negotiations with regulators and banks.\n\n4. **Talent and Networking** – Sports sponsorships often come with **access to athletes, influencers, and high-profile individuals**. These connections can be useful for marketing, partnerships, or even hiring talent. For example, some tennis players have **sponsored crypto projects** or appeared in crypto ads, helping the industry reach new audiences.\n\n5. **Economic Growth of Crypto** – As cryptocurrencies become more widely used, companies in the space are looking for **new ways to integrate into daily life**. Sponsoring sports events is one way to **normalize crypto** in conversations about finance, technology, and even lifestyle.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does \"",

      "title": "XRP news: Ripple expands RLUSD stablecoin use in UAE via Zand Bank",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the XRP News: Ripple Expands RLUSD Stablecoin in the UAE with Zand Bank**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, **stablecoins** are digital currencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to a more stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in price, stablecoins aim to stay as close as possible to their reference currency—making them useful for everyday transactions, payments, and trading without the risk of sudden losses. One of the most well-known stablecoins is **USDT (Tether)**, but there are many others, including **RLUSD**, a stablecoin developed by **Ripple**, the company behind **XRP**.\n\nThis recent news reports that Ripple is working with **Zand Bank**, a financial institution in the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**, to expand the use of RLUSD. The UAE is a major hub for global finance, particularly in the Middle East, and this partnership could help RLUSD become more widely accepted in the region. But what exactly is RLUSD, who is Ripple, and why does this matter for cryptocurrency and traditional banking?\n\n---\n\n### **What Is XRP and Ripple?**\n\nBefore diving into RLUSD, it’s important to understand **XRP** and **Ripple**, the two main players in this story.\n\n**XRP** is a cryptocurrency created in **2012** by **Ripple Labs**, a company founded by **Chris Larsen** and **Jared Smith**. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed as a decentralized digital alternative to traditional money, XRP was built with a different purpose: to facilitate **fast, low-cost cross-border payments**.\n\nRipple Labs developed **XRP** as part of a larger payment network called **RippleNet**. The idea was to use XRP as a \"bridge currency\" to help banks and financial institutions quickly settle transactions between different currencies. For example, if a bank in Japan wanted to send yen to a company in Mexico, it could convert the yen to XRP first, then to pesos, reducing the time and cost of the transaction.\n\nXRP is unique because it doesn’t rely on blockchain technology in the same way as Bitcoin. Instead, it uses a **distributed ledger system** called the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, which is more efficient for large-scale payments. The XRPL can process transactions in just **3–5 seconds**, compared to Bitcoin’s average of **10 minutes** or more. This makes XRP a strong candidate for **real-time settlements**, which are crucial in banking and finance.\n\nHowever, XRP has faced **regulatory challenges**, particularly in the U.S., where the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** has accused Ripple of selling an unregistered security. This legal battle has slowed XRP’s adoption in some markets, but companies like Ripple continue to push for its use in other regions, including the UAE.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is RLUSD?**\n\n**RLUSD** is a **stablecoin** issued by Ripple. As mentioned earlier, stablecoins are meant to keep a steady value, usually tied to a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar. RLUSD is pegged **1:1 to the U.S. dollar**, meaning one RLUSD token should always equal one dollar.\n\nRipple introduced RLUSD in **2023** as part of its efforts to create a **regulated, compliant stablecoin** that banks and financial institutions could trust. Unlike many stablecoins (such as USDT or USDC), which are backed by a mix of cash and other assets, RLUSD is **fully backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds**, which are considered very safe investments. This gives RLUSD a strong claim to being a **true stablecoin**, meaning its value shouldn’t fluctuate much like other stablecoins sometimes do.\n\nThe key advantage of RLUSD is that it is **regulated**—meaning it follows strict financial rules set by governments and financial authorities. This makes it more attractive to banks, which often avoid unregulated cryptocurrencies due to legal and security concerns. In the UAE, where financial regulations are strict but also supportive of innovation, RLUSD’s regulated status could help it gain wider acceptance.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Zand Bank?**\n\n**Zand Bank** is a **digital bank** based in the **UAE**, specifically in **Dubai**. It was founded in **2021** as a subsidiary of **Zand Payments**, a fintech company focused on **cross-border transactions, remittances, and digital payments**.\n\nZand Bank operates under the **UAE’s regulatory framework**, which allows it to provide financial services in a **licensed and supervised** environment. This is important because many countries, including the UAE, have been cautious about cryptocurrencies due to risks like fraud, money laundering, and market instability. However, the UAE has also been **proactive in adopting blockchain and digital assets** to improve financial efficiency.\n\nZand Bank’s partnership with Ripple means it will now **support RLUSD transactions** for its customers. This could allow people in the UAE to use RLUSD for **faster, cheaper international transfers**, especially when dealing with currencies outside the UAE dirham (AED).\n\n---\n\n### **Why Is This Partnership Important?**\n\nThis collaboration between Ripple and Zand Bank matters for several reasons:\n\n#### **1. Expanding Stablecoin Adoption in the UAE**\nThe UAE is a **global financial center**, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi serving as major hubs for trade, remittances, and banking. Many businesses and individuals in the UAE send or receive money internationally, often dealing with delays and",
      "full_text": "Ripple has expanded the reach of its RLUSD stablecoin in the Middle East through a new strategic partnership with UAE-based digital bank Zand, a move that could have longer-term implications for the XRP ecosystem. Under the partnership, Zand and Ripple will collaborate to advance the digital economy by deploying solutions powered by Zand’s AED-backed stablecoin (AEDZ) and Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin (RLUSD). The initiative aims to support the migration of traditional financial services on-chain using stablecoins, blockchain infrastructure, and tokenization. Zand said the partnership represents a “significant step forward” in expanding real-world use cases for digital assets, particularly as regulated financial institutions explore blockchain-based settlement, payments, and liquidity management. By combining AEDZ and RLUSD, the two firms are positioning themselves to facilitate multi-currency on-chain transactions in a regulated environment. While the announcement centers on stablecoins rather than XRP directly, Ripple’s expanding institutional footprint is often viewed as a supportive backdrop for XRP’s long-term utility narrative. XRP has historically traded as a proxy for sentiment around Ripple’s business momentum, particularly in regions where RippleNet adoption is growing. The Ripple token ( XRP ) was exchanging hands at $1.41 at press time, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours. In the near term, XRP price action remains driven by broader crypto market conditions and risk appetite. However, continued progress in stablecoin adoption and enterprise partnerships could reinforce investor confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem over time. As Ripple deepens its presence in the UAE through Zand, the move highlights how stablecoins, not just volatile cryptocurrencies, are becoming a core pillar of blockchain adoption in regulated financial markets.

      "title": "Harvard endowment tilts harder into Bitcoin ETFs than Google stock",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "Here’s a simple, educational breakdown of the crypto news article titled *\"Harvard endowment tilts harder into Bitcoin ETFs than Google stock\"*—written for someone who may be new to cryptocurrency, investments, or financial terms.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does the Article Say?**\nIn late 2023, Harvard University’s investment fund (called the **Harvard Management Company**, or HMC) announced that it was increasing its exposure to **Bitcoin ETFs**—a type of investment product that allows people to bet on Bitcoin’s price without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself. The article highlights that Harvard’s endowment (a large pool of money managed for the university) is now putting more of its funds into Bitcoin ETFs than into **Google stock**, one of the most popular and stable tech investments. This shift shows how seriously some major institutions are taking Bitcoin as an asset, even as traditional investments like stocks remain a cornerstone of their portfolios.\n\n---\n\n### **Background: What Are Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter?**\nBefore diving into Harvard’s decision, it’s important to understand what **Bitcoin ETFs** are and why they’re significant in the world of finance.\n\n#### **What Is Bitcoin?**\nBitcoin is a **digital currency** that operates independently of banks or governments. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Bitcoin is based on a technology called **blockchain**, which is a decentralized ledger (or record) that tracks all transactions across a network of computers. This means no single entity controls Bitcoin, making it resistant to censorship or manipulation by governments.\n\nBitcoin is often called **\"crypto\"** for short, and it’s the most well-known type of cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional money (like dollars or euros), Bitcoin isn’t physical—it exists only as code on computers. People buy and sell Bitcoin on **exchanges**, which are online platforms similar to stock markets but for digital assets.\n\n#### **What Is an ETF?**\nAn **ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)** is a type of investment that tracks an asset, like a stock, commodity, or index, and allows investors to buy or sell shares of it on an exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq). ETFs are popular because they provide **diversification**—meaning you can invest in many assets at once without buying each one individually—and they’re often **lower-cost** than traditional mutual funds.\n\nFor example, if you buy an ETF that tracks the **S&P 500** (a group of 500 large U.S. companies), you own a tiny piece of all those companies without needing to buy shares in each one. ETFs are managed by financial firms, which handle the buying and selling of the underlying assets.\n\n#### **What Is a Bitcoin ETF?**\nA **Bitcoin ETF** is an ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin. Instead of holding actual Bitcoin, the ETF holds Bitcoin-related assets, like **futures contracts** (agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set price in the future) or **Bitcoin-backed securities** (financial products tied to Bitcoin’s value).\n\nThe first **Bitcoin spot ETFs** (which directly hold Bitcoin, not futures) were approved by the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** in January 2024. This was a major moment for crypto because it allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional financial markets—without needing to buy or store Bitcoin themselves.\n\nSome of the first Bitcoin ETFs were offered by well-known companies like **BlackRock** (the world’s largest asset manager), **Fidelity**, **ARK Invest**, and **Bitwise**. These firms had already been preparing for years to get approval, and their ETFs became some of the most popular ways for people to invest in Bitcoin.\n\n#### **Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Important?**\n1. **Easier Access to Bitcoin**: Before ETFs, most people couldn’t invest in Bitcoin through their **brokerage accounts** (like Fidelity or Charles Schwab). They had to use crypto exchanges, which often require setting up a digital wallet or dealing with complicated tax rules. ETFs let investors buy Bitcoin like a stock, using familiar platforms.\n2. **Institutional Adoption**: Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for big institutions (like universities, pension funds, or hedge funds) to invest in Bitcoin. Before, these groups were limited to buying Bitcoin futures, which are riskier and don’t directly track Bitcoin’s price. Now, they can add Bitcoin to their portfolios alongside stocks and bonds.\n3. **Regulation and Legitimacy**: The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs signaled that regulators were starting to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. This helped reduce some of the stigma around crypto and made it more mainstream.\n4. **Price Stability**: Some believe that Bitcoin ETFs will bring more **institutional money** into the market, which could make Bitcoin’s price less volatile (i.e., less likely to swing wildly in short periods).\n\n---\n\n### **Background: Who Is Harvard and What Is Its Endowment?**\nHarvard University is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions in the world, founded in 1636.

Harvard University’s endowment is now leaning harder into Bitcoin btc -2.99% Bitcoin than into Silicon Valley’s most iconic search giant—and markets are taking note “FUN FACT: Harvard University holds more in Bitcoin ETFs than it holds shares in Google,” Bitcoin Magazine posted on X on February 10, distilling a shift years in the making. Regulatory filings show Harvard built a roughly $116.7 million position in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in 2025, lifting its Bitcoin exposure above stakes in Alphabet and other big‑tech mainstays. Subsequent disclosures indicate Harvard increased that wager, with some estimates putting its Bitcoin ETF holdings in the hundreds of millions and ranking the position among its single largest listed assets. Commentary from the digital‑asset industry has been blunt. “Most people think Bitcoin is the gamble, but Harvard’s math clearly suggests that not owning enough of it is the bigger risk to their long‑term portfolio,” wrote SIG Labs. Another bitcoiner framed it more simply: “Bitcoin is moving from theory to balance sheets.” Harvard is not alone. Brown and Emory universities have both disclosed sizable Bitcoin ETF and trust positions, running into the tens of millions of dollars in IBIT and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust. One crypto media noted that “several prominent U.S. university endowments have disclosed investments in cryptocurrency – including Emory, Brown, and Dartmouth Universities.” Harvard’s rotation comes as digital assets again trade as a pure expression of global risk appetite. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is hovering around $68,400, with intraday swings pulling it below $70,000 twice in the past 24 hours as traders digest a near‑50% drawdown from its 2025 peak near $126,000. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands near $4,760, up roughly 2.5% over the last day, while Solana ( SOL ) trades close to $208 after a gain of just over 5%, on volumes above $12 billion. “This is Harvard flipping tech for BTC ETFs,” one trader wrote, calling it “wild” and a sign that “institutional adoption is officially peaking right now.” If that proves true, Bitcoin beating Google inside the world’s richest university endowment may be remembered as more than just a memeable “fun fact.” Best crypto platforms In conversation with Inteliumlaw’s Elena Sadovskaya: Building durable legal structures for crypto businesses Sovereign synergy: Nations must harmonize stablecoins and CBDCs for digital dominance | Opinion 2026 is the year for money on-chain | Opinion America First Crypto Program: What is it and how to profit Crypto is Europe’s best answer to Revolut’s fintech dominance | Opinion Trump disclaims UAE World Liberty stake knowledge, Gemini exits, China bans yuan stablecoins | Weekly Recap Crypto is no longer a ‘crude’ word for companies in the UAE | Opinion VCs investing in Latin America should throw out Silicon Valley’s playbook | Opinion Crypto is dead.

      "title": "Wintermute warns AI-fueled liquidity drain is suffocating Bitcoin",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Wintermute Warns That AI Could Be Draining Bitcoin’s Liquidity**\n\nIn late 2023, a major cryptocurrency company called **Wintermute** published a report suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a significant problem for **Bitcoin (BTC)**—it is **draining liquidity** from the network. Liquidity, in simple terms, refers to how easily an asset (like Bitcoin) can be bought or sold without affecting its price. When liquidity is high, markets function smoothly; when it’s low, prices can swing wildly, and trading becomes difficult. Wintermute’s warning highlights a growing concern in the crypto world: that AI-powered trading strategies might be making Bitcoin harder to trade efficiently, which could hurt its long-term value.\n\nThis article explains what Wintermute is, what Bitcoin liquidity means, how AI might be impacting it, and why this matters—especially for beginners.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Wintermute?**\n\nWintermute is one of the largest **cryptocurrency market makers** in the world. A market maker is a company (or person) that provides liquidity to financial markets by continuously buying and selling assets to ensure there’s always someone willing to trade. Without market makers, it would be much harder to buy or sell large amounts of crypto without moving the price too much.\n\nWintermute operates in **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**, which is a part of the crypto ecosystem where financial services like trading, lending, and borrowing are handled without traditional banks. The company uses algorithms and automated trading systems to help stabilize prices on exchanges (like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken) and make it easier for traders to execute orders.\n\nBefore crypto, market makers existed in traditional stock markets, where firms like **Jane Street** or **Citadel Securities** provided buy and sell orders to keep markets running smoothly. Wintermute plays a similar role in crypto, but on a decentralized scale. The company is based in **Singapore** and was founded in 2020 by **Evan Kuo** and **Jake Chervinsky**, two experienced traders who wanted to improve liquidity in the crypto space.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin Liquidity?**\n\nLiquidity measures how easily an asset can be converted into cash without causing a big price change. In Bitcoin’s case, it means how quickly someone can buy or sell BTC without making the market too volatile (unstable).\n\nFor example:\n- If you want to buy **$1 million worth of Bitcoin**, but there aren’t enough sellers at that price, the price might jump up sharply. This is **low liquidity**.\n- If there are many buyers and sellers at different prices, you can trade without drastically affecting the market. This is **high liquidity**.\n\nBitcoin is the **most liquid cryptocurrency**, meaning it’s generally easier to trade than smaller or newer coins. However, liquidity isn’t evenly distributed across all exchanges. Some platforms (like Binance or Coinbase) have deep order books, while others (especially smaller or newer ones) may struggle to match large trades.\n\nWhen liquidity is high, Bitcoin’s price tends to move more predictably. When it’s low, even small trades can cause big price swings, making it riskier for investors.\n\n---\n\n### **How Is AI Affecting Bitcoin Liquidity?**\n\nWintermute’s report suggests that **AI trading bots**—automated systems that use machine learning to make trading decisions—are **reducing Bitcoin’s liquidity**. Here’s how:\n\n#### **1. AI Bots Are Dominating Trading Volumes**\nAI-powered trading firms (often called **quant funds** or **quantitative trading firms**) have been rapidly growing in crypto. These firms use advanced algorithms to analyze market data, predict trends, and execute trades at lightning speed. Some well-known AI trading companies in crypto include:\n- **Jane Street** (a traditional quant fund that expanded into crypto)\n- **Jump Trading** (another major quant fund)\n- **Alameda Research** (though it collapsed in 2022, it was once a major AI-driven trading firm)\n- **Wintermute itself** (which uses AI to improve liquidity)\n\nThe problem? Many of these AI bots are **not actually adding real liquidity**. Instead, they’re **front-running** (buying or selling before a regular trader can) or **sniping** (quickly buying a large order just before it’s filled to push the price up). This means they’re not helping the market—they’re **taking advantage of it**.\n\n#### **2. AI Bots Are Creating \"Illusionary Liquidity\"**\nWintermute’s report argues that while AI firms *claim* to be improving liquidity, they’re actually **gaming the system**. Here’s how:\n- Some AI bots **post fake orders** (called **spoofing**) to make it seem like there’s more demand or supply than there really is.\n- Others **cancel orders just before they’re executed**, leaving real traders to deal with sudden price jumps.\n- A few AI firms **provide liquidity only to themselves**, meaning they’re not helping outside traders but instead **manipulating the market** to profit.\n\nThis creates the **illusion of liquidity**—the market looks active and stable, but in reality, it’s **less reliable** than it appears.\n\n#### **3. AI Bots Are Reducing Real Market Depth**\nMarket depth refers to the number of **buy and sell orders** at different price levels. A deep market means there are many traders willing to buy or sell, making price movements smoother.\n\nBut AI bots are **not adding real depth**. Instead, they’re:\n- **Filling their own orders first**",
      "full_text": "Wintermute says AI stocks are siphoning liquidity from crypto, leaving Bitcoin stuck in high‑volatility, low‑spot demand price discovery as U.S. selling and ETF outflows bite. Bitcoin’s latest lurch lower is no mystery: liquidity is bleeding into the AI trade, and the crypto market is being left to dance on thinning ice. Market maker Wintermute notes that Bitcoin “briefly fell to $60,000 last Monday, erasing all gains since Trump’s election,” as spot flows reveal “significant structural pressure.” The firm highlights that the “Coinbase premium has consistently been in a discount state… since last December, indicating ongoing selling pressure from the U.S.,” while internal OTC data shows “U.S. counterparties were the main sellers throughout the week,” a trend “amplified by continuous ETF fund redemptions.” Wintermute argues that “over the past few months, AI‑related assets have been continuously absorbing available market funds, crowding out the allocation space for other asset classes,” with crypto underperformance largely explained by “the rotation of funds towards the AI sector.” Last week’s action resembled a “surrender‑style clearing, with volatility soaring and buying support emerging at $60,000,” Wintermute observes, adding that “in an environment where spot trading remains relatively low, leverage has become the dominant factor in price fluctuations.” Without a rebound in open interest, “it will be difficult for the market to form sustained follow‑through on either the long or short side.” A “true structural recovery” now hinges on “a return of spot demand,” a positive Coinbase premium, reversing ETF flows , and stabilizing basis, the firm says. Until then, Bitcoin is “entering a phase of high volatility and choppy price discovery,” with direction “increasingly dominated by institutional fund flows from ETFs and derivatives channels” as retail attention drifts elsewhere. Related coverage on structural selling and ETF flows can be found via ChainCatcher’s analysis of Bitcoin slipping below key moving averages, BlackRock’s renewed transfers to Coinbase Prime, and Hyperscale Data’s growing BTC treasury holdings. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades near $68,700, down less than 1% over 24 hours, on roughly $46B in volume, while total market value hovers around $1.37T. Ethereum’s market cap stands near $242B, with about $28.6B changing hands in the last day. Within AI‑linked crypto, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET token changes hands around $0.16, on roughly $39M in 24‑hour volume. Render render -4.88% Render trades close to $1.31, with about $35.8M in daily turnover. Akash Network akt -2.58% Akash Network is near $0.32, with a market cap just under $92M and 24‑hour volume around $2.8M. SingularityNET (AGIX) sits near $0.07, on modest volume of around $41K. Wintermute’s bottom line is blunt: “For crypto assets to outperform again, AI trading needs to cool down first.” Until that rotation snaps back, Bitcoin’s next act will be written in volatility, not in trend.

      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Explaining \"Saylor Pushes '1.4% Forever' Bitcoin Play to Middle East Wealth Funds\" in Simple Language**\n\nIn late 2023, a well-known investor named **Michael Saylor** made headlines by promoting a new way for wealthy individuals in the Middle East to invest in Bitcoin. His idea, called **\"1.4% forever,\"** suggests that instead of buying Bitcoin directly, these investors could put their money into a company called **MicroStrategy (MSTR)**—which Saylor founded—and let the company hold Bitcoin on their behalf. This approach is controversial and has sparked debates about Bitcoin’s role in traditional finance, how companies manage investments, and whether this strategy is a good long-term plan. Below, we’ll break down what this means, why Saylor is doing it, and what it could imply for Bitcoin and the Middle East’s financial future.\n\n---\n\n### **Who is Michael Saylor?**\nMichael Saylor is the **CEO of MicroStrategy**, a business intelligence company that helps organizations analyze data and make decisions. He became famous in the cryptocurrency world in 2020 when MicroStrategy started buying **Bitcoin** as part of its corporate treasury (the cash reserves a company keeps for safety). At the time, many companies held their money in stocks, bonds, or cash, but Saylor argued that Bitcoin was a better long-term store of value—similar to how gold is used by governments and central banks.\n\nBy the end of 2023, MicroStrategy had spent over **$6 billion** on Bitcoin, holding around **178,000 BTC** (as of this writing). Saylor himself has become a strong advocate for Bitcoin, often tweeting about its potential as a hedge against inflation (when money loses value over time) and economic instability. He even wrote a book, *Bitcoin is Money*, to explain his views.\n\nBecause of his bold moves, Saylor is sometimes called the **\"Bitcoin CEO\"**—a nickname that reflects his belief in the digital currency as a financial asset. However, his strategy is not without criticism. Some argue that holding Bitcoin is risky because its price can swing wildly, while others question whether a private company should be managing such a large portion of its cash in a volatile asset like Bitcoin.\n\n---\n\n### **What is MicroStrategy?**\nMicroStrategy is a **publicly traded company** (meaning its shares are available for investors to buy and sell on stock markets) that specializes in **business intelligence software**. Founded in 1989, it helps companies and governments turn raw data into useful insights—for example, tracking sales trends, customer behavior, or market risks.\n\nThe company has done well over the years, especially after going public in 1998 during the dot-com boom. However, its recent fame comes from its **Bitcoin treasury strategy**. Instead of keeping its cash in traditional assets like U.S. Treasury bonds or stocks, MicroStrategy buys Bitcoin and records it as an **asset on its balance sheet** (a financial statement showing what a company owns and owes). This means that when Bitcoin’s price rises, MicroStrategy’s reported value increases, which can attract more investors.\n\nThe idea behind this strategy is that Bitcoin is **scarce** (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins) and **decentralized** (no single entity controls it), making it a good way to preserve wealth over time—especially in countries where traditional currencies (like the U.S. dollar or Saudi riyal) can lose value due to inflation or government policies.\n\n---\n\n### **What is Bitcoin?**\nBitcoin is the **world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency**, created in 2009 by an unknown person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Unlike traditional money, which is controlled by banks or governments, Bitcoin operates on a **public ledger called the blockchain**, where every transaction is recorded and verified by a network of computers.\n\n#### **Key Features of Bitcoin:**\n1. **Decentralization** – No single bank, government, or corporation controls Bitcoin. Instead, it is maintained by a global network of users.\n2. **Limited Supply** – Only **21 million bitcoins** will ever exist, unlike traditional currencies, which can be printed endlessly. This scarcity is one reason why some people compare Bitcoin to **digital gold**.\n3. **Blockchain Technology** – Bitcoin uses a **blockchain**, a digital record of all transactions that is extremely difficult to alter. New transactions are grouped into \"blocks\" and added to the chain in a secure, transparent way.\n4. **Mining** – Bitcoin is created through a process called **mining**, where powerful computers solve complex math problems to validate transactions. Miners are rewarded with new bitcoins, but this process becomes harder over time as more bitcoins are mined, slowing down the creation of new coins.\n5. **Volatility** – Bitcoin’s price can change **dramatically** in short periods. For example, in 2020, it went from around **$7,000** to **$60,000** in a year, but it has also dropped by **50% or more** in some months. This makes it a high-risk investment.\n6. **Use Cases** – Some people see Bitcoin as a **long-term investment** (like gold), while others use it for **payments** or as a way to protect money in unstable economies. Governments and companies are also starting to recognize it as a **reserve asset** (a safe place to store wealth).\n\nBitcoin is **not backed by any government or bank**, which is both its strength and weakness. On one hand, this means it cannot be",
      "full_text": "Michael Saylor pitches a 1.4% credit‑funded balance‑sheet formula to Middle East capital, aiming to turn corporates into perpetual Bitcoin accumulators in a fragile market. Michael Saylor has found a way to turn balance‑sheet engineering into a perpetual Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulator’s charter — and he is not whispering it, he is broadcasting it to the Middle East. Speaking live on Middle Eastern television, Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor distilled his pitch into a single, aggressive sentence: “If we sell credit instruments equal to 1.4% of our capital assets, we can pay the dividends funded in Bitcoin and we can increase the amount of BTC we have forever.” The logic is brutally simple: monetize a thin slice of the asset base via credit, recycle that into yield‑bearing Bitcoin exposure, and feed shareholders both cash flow and upside without, in his view, diluting the core capital stack. KuCoin’s summary of the framework put it starkly: selling 1.4% of capital assets as credit “could allow the company to boost Bitcoin holdings permanently” while still supporting stock dividends. This approach extends a strategy he outlined at the Bitcoin MENA conference, where he told regional sovereign funds in the Middle East that “Bitcoin is digital capital, or digital gold, and digital credit builds on it by stripping out volatility to generate yield.” Saylor’s formula lands in a market where Bitcoin itself has turned into the cleanest proxy for global risk appetite. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades around $70,345, with a 24‑hour range between roughly $68,428 and $71,852 on about $59.3B in volume. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands near $2,012, with 24‑hour trading volume close to $28.7B and intraday prints between about $1,999 and $2,140. Solana ( SOL ) sits around $86, with roughly $3.9B traded over the last day as it grinds through a 2025–26 drawdown. XRP ( XRP ) hovers near $1.44, down about 1% over the last 24 hours as on‑chain data flags a “stop‑loss phase” after months of distribution. crypto+8 This parabolic move comes as digital assets continue to trade as the purest expression of macro risk appetite. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is hovering around $70,345, with a 24‑hour high near $71,852 and a low near $68,428, on roughly $59.3B in dollar volumes. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands close to $2,012, with about $28.7B in 24‑hour turnover and spot quotes clustered in the $2,000–$2,100 band on major exchanges earlier this week. Solana trades around $86, up modestly over the last 24 hours, with nearly $3.9B in volume. crypto+5 Saylor has been explicit about his target audience. In Abu Dhabi, he claimed to have met “every Middle East sovereign wealth fund” to pitch Bitcoin‑backed credit as a superior fixed‑income replacement, promising “two to four times” traditional yields while using corporate structures like Strategy as leverage amplifiers. The sales pitch collides with a more fragile tape. Bitcoin has slipped below $70,000 amid what one analyst called an “unpumpable” market, with selling pressure overwhelming inflows after a 45% drawdown from the 2025 peak. Whether Saylor’s 1.4% rule becomes a template or a cautionary tale will be decided not in televised sound bites, but in the next macro stress test.

      "title": "Hyperscale Data doubles down on Bitcoin as treasury hits 589 BTC",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Hyperscale Data Doubles Down on Bitcoin: What Does It Mean?**\n\nIn late October 2024, a company called **Hyperscale Data** announced that it had acquired **589 Bitcoin (BTC)** for its treasury, bringing its total holdings to **1,389 BTC**. This news was reported by **Bitcoin Magazine**, a publication that covers developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hyperscale Data, a relatively new player in the crypto space, is a **data center company** that specializes in providing high-performance computing infrastructure for businesses. Its decision to hold such a large amount of Bitcoin—worth around **$100 million at the time of writing**—is significant for several reasons, including how it reflects growing corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset.\n\nFor beginners, this might sound confusing. Why would a data center company buy Bitcoin? What does it mean for the broader crypto market? And why is this considered a \"double down\"? Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Hyperscale Data?**\n\nHyperscale Data is a **data center operator** that focuses on building and maintaining large-scale computing facilities. Data centers are the physical buildings where companies store their servers, process data, and run cloud computing services. They are critical for modern businesses, especially those relying on digital infrastructure like banks, tech firms, and even cryptocurrency companies.\n\nThe term **\"hyperscale\"** refers to data centers that handle massive amounts of computing power—far beyond what a typical business would need. These facilities are designed to support **AI, machine learning, blockchain, and other high-demand technologies** by providing energy-efficient, high-speed servers. Hyperscale Data was founded in **2023** and operates in **Texas, USA**, where energy costs are relatively low compared to other regions.\n\nBefore this Bitcoin purchase, Hyperscale Data was not widely known outside of the data center industry. However, its decision to accumulate such a large amount of Bitcoin has put it in the spotlight, as it suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin, and Why Do Companies Hold It?**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the first and most well-known **decentralized digital currency**, created in **2009** by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or bank. Instead, it operates on a **peer-to-peer network** using blockchain technology—a public ledger that records all transactions securely and transparently.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin has gained attention as a **store of value**, similar to gold. Some investors and companies believe it can protect against inflation because its supply is **limited to 21 million coins**, which cannot be changed. This scarcity makes Bitcoin attractive as a **hedge (protection) against economic instability**, especially in countries with volatile currencies.\n\n#### **Why Would a Company Like Hyperscale Data Buy Bitcoin?**\nCompanies hold Bitcoin in their treasuries (like a corporate savings account) for several reasons:\n\n1. **Hedge Against Inflation** – If a company expects traditional currencies (like the U.S. dollar) to lose value due to inflation, Bitcoin can act as a safeguard because its supply is fixed.\n2. **Long-Term Investment** – Some firms see Bitcoin as a **long-term asset** that could appreciate in value over time, just like stocks or real estate.\n3. **Decentralization** – Bitcoin is not controlled by any single entity, meaning its value is not tied to government policies or bank failures.\n4. **Global Acceptance** – Bitcoin can be easily moved across borders without relying on traditional financial systems, which is useful for international businesses.\n5. **Speculative Growth** – Even though Bitcoin is volatile in the short term, some companies bet that its price will rise significantly in the future.\n\nHyperscale Data’s move is part of a broader trend where **corporations, hedge funds, and even some governments** are adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. For example, **MicroStrategy**, a business intelligence company, was one of the first major public firms to hold Bitcoin in **2020**. Since then, it has acquired thousands of Bitcoin, worth billions at peak prices. Similarly, **Tesla** (the electric car company) held Bitcoin for a while before selling some of its reserves in **2021**.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does \"Doubling Down\" Mean?**\n\nThe phrase **\"doubling down\"** comes from gambling, where a player increases their bet after already placing a large one. In finance, it means **increasing an existing investment** even if the asset’s price has fallen.\n\nHyperscale Data’s Bitcoin holdings were previously **800 BTC**, but it now owns **1,389 BTC**. This suggests that the company is **committed to Bitcoin as an asset**, possibly because it sees long-term value despite short-term price swings.\n\nAt the time of the purchase, Bitcoin was trading around **$170,000 per coin**, meaning Hyperscale Data spent roughly **$100 million** on the new batch. However, Bitcoin’s price has since dropped to about **$85,000** (as of late 2024), meaning the company’s total Bitcoin holdings are now worth less than before.\n\nBy buying more Bitcoin at a lower price, Hyperscale Data is **increasing its exposure** to the asset, hoping that its value will rise again in the future. This strategy is risky because Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly, but it also shows that the company believes in Bitcoin’s potential as a **long-term store of value**.\n\n---\n\n###",
      "full_text": "Hyperscale Data lifts its Bitcoin treasury to 589 BTC and targets $100m, using a strict dollar‑cost‑averaging plan as crypto remains a macro risk barometer. Hyperscale Data tightens its grip on Bitcoin as treasury tops 589 BTC, sharpening a balance‑sheet bet on digital assets at a time when crypto remains the market’s rawest barometer of risk appetite. Hyperscale Data, Inc. said in a press release published today its Bitcoin treasury reached 589.4502 BTC as of February 8, 2026, with an implied value of roughly $41.4m at a closing Bitcoin price of $70,264. The company reiterated that its goal is to accumulate $100m worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet over time. Executive chairman Milton “Todd” Ault III framed the move as deliberate and incremental, stressing discipline over bravado. “We continue to demonstrate our dedication to our dollar‑cost average strategy,” he said, arguing that this approach “has allowed us to continually lower our average cost per Bitcoin and further strengthen the balance sheet and long‑term future of the Company.” Through its subsidiaries Sentinum, Inc. and Ault Capital Group, Inc. (ACG), Hyperscale now holds 589.4502 BTC, with Sentinum controlling about 548.5903 BTC and ACG approximately 40.8994 BTC. Sentinum’s stack includes 108.3562 BTC mined in‑house and 440.2341 BTC bought in the open market, while ACG added 8.9000 BTC during the week ended February 8. The firm plans to “fully deploy the cash allocated to its digital asset treasury (‘DAT’) strategy into Bitcoin purchases over time,” typically targeting at least 5% of allocated cash each week via daily buys, though actual deployment will flex with “market conditions and strategic considerations.” Management told investors to judge accumulation using multi‑week averages, consistent with first‑principles DCA practice common among institutional allocators. This parabolic move comes as digital assets continue to trade as the purest expression of macro risk appetite.

      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Article: \"Nitro Backs Execution-First Monad Startups with Up to $500k Each\"**\n\nThis article is about a new funding initiative called **Nitro**, which is supporting early-stage startups building projects using a technology called **\"monads\"**—a concept from computer science. The term \"execution-first\" suggests that these startups are prioritizing practical, real-world applications of monads over purely theoretical or academic research. The funding can go up to **$500,000 per startup**, which is a significant amount for early-stage projects. To break this down in simple terms, we’ll explore what monads are, why they matter in computing, how Nitro is using them in startups, and what this means for the broader world of blockchain and decentralized technology.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Monads?**\n\nMonads might sound like a complex or abstract idea, but they are actually a **fundamental concept in computer science** that helps manage side effects in programming. Side effects are changes that happen outside a function—like reading from a file, modifying a database, or sending a transaction—that make code harder to predict and debug.\n\nA monad is a **mathematical structure** that provides a clean, structured way to handle these side effects. Think of it as a \"wrapper\" around a function that enforces rules about how data flows in and out. This makes programs more reliable and easier to reason about.\n\nThe idea was first introduced in **category theory** (a branch of math that studies relationships between different structures) in the 1960s by **Andrei Ershov**, a Soviet computer scientist. Later, **Eugene Wigner**, a Hungarian-American mathematician, and **Philip Wadler**, a British computer scientist, expanded on the concept. Monads became widely popular in **functional programming** (a programming style that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions) because they help developers write code that is **pure, predictable, and reusable**.\n\nIn programming, monads are used in languages like **Haskell, Rust, and Scala** to handle tasks such as:\n- **State management** (e.g., keeping track of variables in a program)\n- **Error handling** (e.g., safely dealing with failures without crashing)\n- **Asynchronous operations** (e.g., waiting for network responses without blocking code)\n- **Transaction processing** (e.g., ensuring that multiple steps in a blockchain transaction happen correctly)\n\nFor example, in Rust (a systems programming language often used in blockchain development), monads help manage memory safely, preventing bugs like crashes or data corruption. In Haskell, they’re used for input/output operations, making it easier to write programs that don’t behave unpredictably.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Monads Matter in Blockchain and Crypto**\n\nBlockchain technology relies heavily on **secure, predictable, and composable** computations. Since blockchain is decentralized, every node (computer running the network) must agree on the outcome of a transaction or smart contract. If code behaves unpredictably—due to side effects, bugs, or race conditions—it can lead to **security vulnerabilities, lost funds, or failed contracts**.\n\nMonads help solve this problem by:\n1. **Making Code More Reliable** – They enforce strict rules about how data flows, reducing the chance of errors.\n2. **Improving Security** – Since monads handle side effects in a controlled way, they can prevent issues like **reentrancy attacks** (where a smart contract is tricked into giving up control of funds) or **integer overflows** (where calculations go wrong due to limits in number storage).\n3. **Enabling Better Smart Contracts** – Many modern blockchain languages (like Rust, Haskell, and even some experimental Solidity patterns) use monadic concepts to write **safer and more efficient** smart contracts.\n4. **Supporting Formal Verification** – Monads help in **proving mathematically** that code behaves as intended, which is crucial for high-stakes systems like DeFi (Decentralized Finance) or DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).\n\nSome blockchain projects already use monadic principles:\n- **Rust (used in Solana, Polkadot, and Near)** – Rust’s ownership system (which prevents memory bugs) is deeply influenced by monadic thinking.\n- **Haskell (used in some research-oriented blockchains)** – Haskell’s strong monad support makes it ideal for writing **correct-by-construction** smart contracts.\n- **CosmWasm (a smart contract platform for Cosmos)** – Uses Rust and monadic patterns to ensure secure execution.\n\nHowever, most blockchain developers today still work with **imperative programming** (a style where code directly changes state, like in Solidity or JavaScript). This can lead to **unpredictable behavior**, especially in complex smart contracts. Monads offer an alternative by making computation **more structured and less error-prone**.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is \"Execution-First\" in This Context?**\n\nThe phrase **\"execution-first\"** refers to startups that are **prioritizing real-world use cases** over theoretical research. In other words, these teams aren’t just exploring monads as an academic exercise—they’re building **working products** that actually solve problems in blockchain or decentralized computing.\n\nThis is different from how many crypto projects start: with a **whitepaper-heavy approach**, focusing on novel ideas before proving they work. Execution-first startups, instead, focus on:\n- **Building functional prototypes** (small, working versions of their software)\n- **Solving specific pain points** (like gas inefficiency, security flaws, or scalability issues)\n- **Iterating quickly** (testing and improving their tech before scaling)\n\nNitro is backing these startups because it believes monads (and",
      "full_text": "Nitro, a Monad-focused accelerator, offers up to $7.5M to execution-driven teams to turn already-funded crypto projects into products that actually ship. Nitro, a crypto accelerator built around the Monad blockchain, opened applications Tuesday with a promise to fix one of the industry’s most predictable failures: founders who raise fast and ship slow. The program will back up to 15 early‑stage teams with as much as $7.5 million in total funding, or up to $500,000 per project over a three‑month program split between New York and remote work. Nitro is not subtle about its diagnosis of the market. The one‑sheet describes a “common issue in crypto venture funding: teams often raise capital quickly but struggle to ship production‑ready products or reach product‑market fit.” In response, the accelerator is “structured around execution, shipping cadence, and validation, rather than short‑term growth metrics or token‑driven incentives,” positioning itself explicitly against the raise‑then‑drift pattern that defined much of the last cycle. The inaugural cohort targets infrastructure, developer tools, and user‑facing applications on Monad, with a stated preference for founders already “demonstrat[ing] consistent shipping and a clear path toward product‑market fit.” The program culminates in a Demo Day for crypto and tech investors, including backers Paradigm, Electric Capital, Dragonfly , and Castle Island Ventures, who are expected to provide “mentorship, feedback, and Demo Day engagement” rather than just logos on a slide. Nitro arrives after more than $108 million has already been raised by projects in the Monad ecosystem, and $244 million in funding for Monad itself from Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures, and others. The foundation describes Monad as “a high‑performance, EVM‑compatible Layer 1 built for high‑frequency finance and autonomous systems,” with mainnet going live in November 2025. In plain terms: there is already plenty of money in this corner of crypto; the missing piece is disciplined execution. That tension is playing out against a softer but still risk‑on tape. Bitcoin btc -2.99% Bitcoin trades near $70,096, down about 0.6% over 24 hours. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands around $2,104, edging up roughly 0.5% on the day. Solana ( SOL ) sits near $86.70, after a choppy week that has seen intraday prints above $89. If previous bull markets rewarded narratives and fully diluted valuations, Nitro is making a narrower, more verifiable bet: in a capital‑heavy ecosystem, the teams that matter now will be the ones that can ship on time—and survive without another hype cycle to bail them out.

      "title": "Chainlink founder says these 3 trends will define crypto’s next era",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Chainlink Founder Explains Three Key Trends That Will Shape the Future of Crypto**\n\nIn a recent interview, **Sergey Nazarov**, the co-founder of **Chainlink** (a decentralized oracle network used in blockchain smart contracts), discussed three major trends he believes will define the next phase of cryptocurrency. His insights provide a useful breakdown of where the industry might be headed, especially for beginners who are trying to understand the deeper forces behind crypto’s growth. Chainlink has been one of the most important projects in blockchain since its launch in 2017, helping smart contracts access real-world data securely. Nazarov’s predictions focus on **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, **artificial intelligence (AI)**, and **regulatory clarity**—three areas that are already shaping the crypto space but could see even bigger changes in the coming years.\n\nTo fully grasp why these trends matter, it’s helpful to first understand the key players and technologies involved.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – The Rise of Trustless Financial Systems**\n\n#### **What is DeFi?**\nDecentralized Finance, or **DeFi**, is a movement within crypto that aims to replace traditional financial services—like banking, lending, and trading—with **blockchain-based alternatives**. Instead of relying on banks or other middlemen, DeFi uses **smart contracts** (self-executing code on a blockchain) to automate transactions, reduce costs, and increase transparency.\n\nFor example, if you want to borrow money in the real world, you usually need a bank, which checks your credit score, verifies your identity, and sets interest rates. In DeFi, you can borrow directly from a **decentralized lending protocol** (like **Aave** or **Compound**) by locking up crypto as collateral. The smart contract handles everything automatically—no paperwork, no approval delays, and no bank fees.\n\n#### **Why Does Chainlink Matter for DeFi?**\nSmart contracts need **real-world data** to function properly. If a DeFi loan contract depends on the price of Bitcoin, it needs a reliable way to get that price. But blockchain networks like **Ethereum** (where most DeFi runs) are **isolated**—they don’t have direct access to external information. This is where **oracles** come in.\n\nAn **oracle** is a third-party service that bridges the gap between blockchains and real-world data. Chainlink is one of the most widely used oracle networks because it is **decentralized**, meaning no single entity controls the data. Instead, multiple independent \"nodes\" (computers) provide and verify information before it’s fed into a smart contract.\n\nWithout oracles like Chainlink, DeFi would be limited to **on-chain** (blockchain-only) data, making it useless for things like stock prices, weather updates, or sports scores. Chainlink’s role is critical because it ensures smart contracts get **accurate, tamper-proof data** without relying on a single, trustworthy source.\n\n#### **The Three Sub-Trends in DeFi**\nNazarov identified three specific developments within DeFi that will likely dominate the next era:\n\n1. **Cross-Chain Interoperability** – Currently, most DeFi protocols operate on a single blockchain (like Ethereum). But users want to move assets between different chains (e.g., Ethereum and **Solana**) without friction. Projects like **Polygon** (a scaling solution for Ethereum) and **Arbitrum** (a layer-2 network) are already working on this, but true **cross-chain DeFi** (where you can use assets from multiple blockchains in one application) is still emerging. Chainlink could play a key role here by providing **secure data feeds** across different blockchains.\n\n2. **Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization** – One of the biggest criticisms of crypto is that most digital assets are **speculative** (like Bitcoin or Ethereum). **Real-World Assets (RWAs)**—such as stocks, bonds, or even real estate—are being tokenized (turned into digital tokens) to bring traditional finance into DeFi. Companies like **Centrifuge** and **Maple Finance** already allow users to trade tokenized debt or real estate. However, scaling this up requires **better oracles** to verify asset values in real time. Chainlink’s decentralized approach could help make RWA trading more reliable.\n\n3. **Hybrid Smart Contracts** – Most smart contracts today are **fully on-chain**, meaning they only interact with blockchain data. But the next wave will involve **hybrid contracts**, which combine on-chain and off-chain logic. For instance, a smart contract could use AI to analyze market trends but still rely on Chainlink for verified price data. This could make DeFi applications **more flexible and powerful**, as they won’t be limited to simple, pre-programmed rules.\n\n#### **Why This Trend Matters**\nDeFi has already disrupted traditional finance by offering **permissionless, low-cost alternatives** to banks. However, it still faces challenges, such as **scalability** (slow transactions) and **security risks** (hacks, incorrect data). If DeFi can solve these problems—especially by integrating real-world assets and cross-chain functionality—it could become a **true global financial system**, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nFor users, this means **more financial tools** (like insurance, derivatives, and automated investments) without needing a bank. For developers, it opens up **new ways to build trustless applications**. And for institutions, it could reduce reliance on slow, expensive traditional systems.\n\nBut DeFi won’t succeed alone—it needs **better infrastructure**, and Chainlink’s oracles are a",
      "full_text": "Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov says the current market cycle is offering a clearer view of where crypto is headed next – not through price action, but through structural changes taking place beneath the surface. In a post on X, Nazarov argued that the most important signals this cycle are emerging from infrastructure resilience and real-world adoption rather than speculation. This suggests the industry is entering a more durable phase. Nazarov’s first signal of progress is the absence of large, cascading institutional collapses during recent market drawdowns. He noted that despite sharp volatility , the industry has avoided the kind of failures that defined the previous cycle. “This cycle so far has not had the same types of cascading institutional blowups,” Nazarov wrote, pointing to improved risk management and capital discipline across crypto firms. According to Nazarov, this resilience is a critical prerequisite for long-term institutional participation and signals a maturing market structure. The second trend shaping crypto’s next era is the steady migration of real-world assets (RWAs) onto blockchains. Nazarov emphasized that tokenization activity is continuing even as broader crypto markets fluctuate. “The adoption of RWAs is continuing independent of crypto market cycles,” he said, highlighting on-chain issuance and the growth of perpetual markets tied to traditional assets such as commodities. He added that features like 24/7 trading, transparent collateral, and global access are driving demand beyond speculative use cases. Nazarov’s final trend centers on infrastructure. As RWAs scale, he said the need for reliable data, interoperability, and secure coordination between on-chain and off-chain systems is increasing rapidly. “In the long run, RWAs can become larger than crypto-native assets,” Nazarov wrote, suggesting blockchains are evolving into foundational financial infrastructure rather than niche markets.

      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Crypto News: Solana’s Ultra-Low Fees Challenge Base, BNB, and Polygon in DeFi**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, **decentralized finance (DeFi)** is one of the most exciting and rapidly growing areas. DeFi refers to financial services—like lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest—built on blockchain technology without traditional banks or middlemen. Instead, smart contracts (self-executing agreements written in code) handle transactions automatically, and users interact directly with these systems through decentralized apps (dApps).\n\nFor DeFi to work smoothly, blockchain networks need to be **fast, secure, and cheap**. If transactions cost too much, people won’t use the system. If they’re too slow, users get frustrated. Right now, three blockchain networks—**Solana, Base (by Coinbase), and Polygon (by Polygon Labs)**—are competing to become the go-to platforms for DeFi. The key difference? **Solana is offering extremely low fees**, which could make it a serious threat to the others.\n\nBut what does this mean for regular users, developers, and investors? And why is it important? Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **The Three Blockchains in the Spotlight**\n\n#### **1. Solana (SOL)**\nSolana is a **high-speed blockchain** designed to handle thousands of transactions per second at very low costs. It was launched in 2020 by **Solana Labs**, a company founded by **Anatoly Yakovenko**, a former Qualcomm engineer, and **Greg Fitzgerald**, a former Dropbox executive. The goal was to create a blockchain that could rival Ethereum in speed and scalability (ability to process many transactions) while keeping fees affordable.\n\nSolana uses a unique technology called **\"Proof of History\" (PoH)** alongside **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to make transactions faster and cheaper. PoH is like a digital clock that helps the network agree on the order of transactions without waiting for miners to confirm them. This makes Solana much faster than older blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which rely on slower consensus mechanisms.\n\nThe **SOL token** is Solana’s native cryptocurrency, used to pay for transactions and secure the network. Unlike Ethereum, where gas fees can spike to hundreds of dollars during busy times, Solana often charges just **a fraction of a cent** per transaction—even when many people are using it.\n\n#### **2. Base (by Coinbase)**\nBase is a **Layer 2 (L2) blockchain** built on top of Ethereum. It was created by **Coinbase**, one of the largest and most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, to make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains are like \"express lanes\" for Ethereum, processing transactions off the main chain and then settling them on Ethereum later. This reduces congestion and lowers fees. Base launched in **August 2023** and quickly became popular because it allowed Ethereum users to easily access cheaper transactions without needing to learn a new blockchain.\n\nThe **ETH token** (Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency) is used on Base, but transactions are often much cheaper than on Ethereum itself. Base also introduced a **\"gas fee rebate\"** system, where users get some of their transaction costs back, making it even more attractive.\n\n#### **3. Polygon (by Polygon Labs)**\nPolygon (formerly Matic Network) is another **Layer 2 solution** for Ethereum, created by **Polygon Labs**, a company founded in **2017** by **Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun, and Mihailo Bjelic**. Its main purpose is to improve Ethereum’s scalability by allowing thousands of transactions per second at lower fees.\n\nPolygon works by using **sidechains** (separate blockchains connected to Ethereum) and **rollups** (a method that bundles many transactions into one to reduce fees). The **MATIC token** (now called **POL**) is used to pay for gas fees on Polygon’s network.\n\nPolygon has been around longer than Base and has a strong developer community. It’s also backed by major companies like **Binance**, which helped it grow. However, its fees are still higher than Solana’s in many cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Are Low Fees Important in DeFi?**\n\nDeFi apps rely on blockchain networks to execute transactions. If fees are too high, users will avoid them, leading to less activity and slower growth. Here’s why low fees matter:\n\n#### **1. Accessibility for Small Users**\nMany DeFi users are **retail investors**—people who don’t have thousands of dollars to spend on transaction fees. For example:\n- If you want to **swap tokens** (exchange one cryptocurrency for another) on Uniswap (an Ethereum-based DeFi platform), a single trade might cost **$50–$100** in gas fees during peak times.\n- On Solana, the same swap could cost **just $0.01–$0.10**.\n\nThis makes DeFi **much more practical** for everyday users, not just big institutions.\n\n#### **2. Faster Transactions = Better User Experience**\nHigh fees often mean **slow transactions**, especially on Ethereum. If you’re trying to trade or interact with a DeFi app, waiting **minutes or even hours** for a transaction to confirm is frustrating.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, can process **50,000–65,000 transactions per second**, making it **one of the fastest blockchains** in the world. This speed is crucial for:\n- **",
      "full_text": "Solana cements structurally low, predictable fees versus rollup-heavy rivals, reinforcing its role as a high-throughput chain for cost-sensitive, high-volume apps. Solana sol -5.81% Solana recorded the second-lowest median transaction fees among major blockchain networks as of mid-January 2026, trailing only Avalanche, according to recent fee comparison data . The blockchain’s median fee remained several times lower than Base’s median over the same period, the data showed. Solana’s fee structure reflected its execution-layer design in an ecosystem increasingly dominated by rollup solutions. Ethereum maintained the highest fees among major chains displayed in the comparison, reflecting continued demand and periodic congestion at the base layer, according to the data. Polygon and Linea fell in the mid-range, while BNB, Arbitrum, and Base recorded lower fees but remained above Solana’s cost level. Solana’s fee line remained consistently near the bottom of the logarithmic-scale chart, indicating a structurally low-fee environment rather than occasional cheap transactions. The network achieved this through high throughput and parallelized execution, which allowed it to absorb activity spikes without translating demand into higher per-transaction costs, according to network documentation. Median fees reflect what typical users pay rather than edge cases during congestion periods. Solana’s position indicated that most transactions continued to clear at low cost even during periods of elevated usage, the data showed. Networks built on rollup stacks inherited some cost sensitivity from settlement layers, particularly during periods of higher calldata demand, according to blockchain analysts. For applications requiring frequent user interactions, such as payments, gaming, or on-chain trading, fee predictability remained a significant factor alongside transaction speed. Solana’s low median fee profile reinforced its positioning as an execution-focused chain optimized for high-volume activity, according to industry observers. Developers building consumer-facing applications often selected environments where costs remained low at scale, while chains like Base offered tighter integration with Ethereum’s tooling and liquidity in exchange for slightly higher fees. The ability to maintain low median fees without sacrificing throughput represented a key differentiator as usage continued to grow across blockchain ecosystems, according to network performance analysts.

      "title": "Fresh capital dries up as Bitcoin demand thins, CryptoQuant warns",
      "source": "Crypto.News",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the CryptoQuant Bitcoin Demand Warning: A Simple Explanation**\n\nIn early 2024, a crypto analytics company called **CryptoQuant** published a report warning that **Bitcoin’s demand is thinning out**, meaning fewer people are buying it compared to its supply. This news is important because Bitcoin’s price is influenced by how much demand exists for it relative to how much is available. If demand drops, the price could fall. But why does this matter, and what does it mean for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market? To understand this, we need to look at Bitcoin’s history, how it works, and what factors affect its price.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin is the world’s first **decentralized digital currency**, created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. Unlike traditional money issued by governments (like the U.S. dollar or euro), Bitcoin operates without a central authority—such as a bank or government—controlling it. Instead, transactions are verified by a network of computers using complex mathematics and cryptography, which is why it’s called a **cryptocurrency**.\n\nBitcoin was designed as a way to transfer value directly between people without needing a middleman. It also has a **fixed supply**: only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, and this limit is built into its code. New Bitcoins are created through a process called **mining**, where powerful computers solve puzzles to add transactions to a public ledger (the **blockchain**). This process slows down over time, making Bitcoin scarcer as it gets older.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Demand in Bitcoin?**\n\nDemand in Bitcoin refers to how many people want to buy it. Just like stocks or real estate, Bitcoin’s price depends on whether more people want to own it (demand) or more people want to sell it (supply). If demand is high and supply is low, the price goes up. If demand drops and supply stays the same or increases, the price can fall.\n\nBitcoin’s demand comes from different sources:\n1. **Investors** – People who buy Bitcoin hoping its value will rise over time.\n2. **Hodlers** – Long-term holders who believe in Bitcoin’s future and don’t sell quickly.\n3. **Institutions** – Big companies, banks, and funds that invest in Bitcoin as a hedge (a way to protect against risk) or as an asset.\n4. **Traders** – Speculators who buy and sell Bitcoin for short-term profits.\n5. **Users** – People who actually spend Bitcoin (though this is still a small part of its demand).\n\nCryptoQuant tracks **Bitcoin’s demand metrics**, such as how much new money is entering the market, how many people are holding Bitcoin, and how quickly they’re moving it. When these metrics show that fewer people are buying Bitcoin, it suggests that the price could be under pressure.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is CryptoQuant?**\n\n**CryptoQuant** is a data analysis company that specializes in tracking cryptocurrency markets. Founded in 2018 by **Ki Young Ju**, a former Wall Street analyst, the company provides tools for traders, investors, and researchers to understand how Bitcoin and other digital assets are being used.\n\nCryptoQuant collects and analyzes data from **cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, mining pools, and on-chain transactions** (recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain). This helps them identify trends, such as:\n- How much Bitcoin is being moved between exchanges and personal wallets.\n- Whether miners (who produce new Bitcoin) are selling or holding their coins.\n- How long Bitcoin has been held by different users (short-term vs. long-term).\n\nThe company’s reports are often cited by crypto analysts and news outlets because they provide **clear, data-driven insights** into what’s happening in the market. Their warnings are based on real activity, not just guesses.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does \"Fresh Capital Dries Up\" Mean?**\n\nCryptoQuant’s warning about **\"fresh capital drying up\"** refers to a key factor in Bitcoin’s price movement: **new money entering the market**. When Bitcoin’s price is rising, new investors often buy in, adding more demand. This is called **\"fresh capital\"**—new funds that push the price higher.\n\nHowever, if fewer new investors are entering the market while existing holders keep selling, the price can struggle to stay up. CryptoQuant’s data showed that in early 2024:\n- **Net inflows into Bitcoin exchange wallets** (where people store Bitcoin before trading) were negative, meaning more people were selling than buying.\n- **Miners were selling more Bitcoin** than usual, likely because the price had dropped, making it harder for them to profit.\n- **Long-term holders (LTHs)**—people who have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days—were also reducing their positions, meaning they were selling rather than accumulating.\n\nWhen these groups (miners, LTHs, and new investors) stop adding demand or start selling, it creates a **downward pressure on the price**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Does This Matter?**\n\nBitcoin’s price is influenced by many factors, including:\n- **Supply and demand** (the most basic driver).\n- **Market sentiment** (how people feel about Bitcoin).\n- **Regulation** (government rules affecting crypto).\n- **Macroeconomic conditions** (interest rates, inflation, stock market performance).\n\nBut **supply and demand is the most immediate and powerful force**. If new buyers aren’t entering the market, the price can’t rise unless existing holders stop selling. CryptoQuant’s warning suggests that Bitcoin’s price may be vulnerable to further declines unless demand picks up again.\n\n",
      "full_text": "CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin’s slide is now driven by negative inflows, weak spot demand and fading risk appetite, raising the odds of an early-stage bear market. Bitcoin’s btc -2.99% Bitcoin latest slide is starting to look less like a healthy correction and more like the opening stages of a grind‑down bear. CryptoQuant’s on‑chain data shows that fresh money simply is not stepping in to catch the falling knife. CryptoQuant sums up the mood in one blunt line: “New investor inflows have flipped negative. The sell‑off is not being absorbed by fresh capital.” In their words, “In bull markets, drawdowns attract accelerating capital. In early bear markets, weakness triggers withdrawal.” That dynamic is now visible on chain , with the firm’s latest bear market assessment highlighting that Bitcoin has dropped roughly 23% over the last 80‑plus days after breaking below its 365‑day moving average for the first time since 2022. External analysts are reading the same tape. A recent breakdown notes that spot and institutional demand remain weak, while risk‑adjusted returns, as measured by the Sharpe ratio, have sunk to zones historically associated with late‑stage bull unwinds or entrenched bear markets. As one market commentator put it: “drawdowns without fresh buyers tend to linger. In stronger regimes, dips pull in new capital fast; here, they’re just not showing up.” At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades near $68,979, down about 2% over the last 24 hours, roughly 12% over the week and close to 30% year‑on‑year, after falling nearly 45% from its October 2025 all‑time high around $126,080. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands close to $2,012.92, with 24‑hour turnover of about $28.7B, a daily loss of roughly 1.4% and a 7‑day slide above 12%. Solana ( SOL ) sits around $86.02, marginally lower on the day, but down about 13% on the week and roughly 35% over the past month. This parabolic move comes as digital assets continue to trade as the purest expression of macro risk appetite. Bitcoin is now struggling to hold the $70k area as “selling pressure overwhelms inflows,” with one analyst going as far as to call BTC “unpumpable” in the short term. Ethereum faces its own headwinds after a cycle of overheated leverage and extreme funding that has historically preceded sharp corrective moves. Solana, meanwhile, remains capped by a “bearish structure” as falling volume and shrinking open interest keep downside risk in focus. The key question now is whether negative inflows harden into sustained outflows. CryptoQuant warns that without a clear pickup in new demand, the current pattern of “weakness triggering withdrawal” looks less like a brief pause and more like the architecture of a true bear market.

      "summary": "### **Understanding the FIGR_HELOC Crypto News Article (Explained in Simple Terms)**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, new projects often emerge with bold claims about revolutionizing finance, technology, or even how we access loans. One such project is **FIGR_HELOC**, which has been making headlines recently. At first glance, the name may sound confusing—it’s not a well-known cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and it doesn’t follow the usual naming conventions (such as \"FIGR\" or \"HELOC\" alone being recognizable). To understand what FIGR_HELOC is and why it matters, we need to break it down into its key components: the technology behind it, the companies and people involved, and the broader financial concept it represents.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is FIGR_HELOC?**\nFIGR_HELOC appears to be a **financial product** tied to blockchain technology, specifically designed to provide **Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)** using cryptocurrencies as collateral. A HELOC is a type of loan that allows homeowners to borrow against the value of their property, much like a credit card but secured by real estate. Instead of traditional banks, FIGR_HELOC seems to rely on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, where users can lock up crypto assets to get cash loans without needing a bank or credit check.\n\nThe name **\"FIGR_HELOC\"** likely refers to:\n- **FIGR** – This could be short for **\"Figure Technologies\"** (a well-known company in DeFi lending) or a different project (since \"FIGR\" isn’t a widely recognized cryptocurrency yet).\n- **HELOC** – A standard financial term for **Home Equity Line of Credit**, meaning a loan backed by a home’s value.\n\nIf this is indeed a collaboration between **Figure Technologies** and another entity (or a new token by Figure), it suggests a way to bridge traditional real estate-backed loans with crypto collateral. However, since the article is blank, we’ll have to rely on general knowledge about similar projects to explain how this might work.\n\n---\n\n### **Background: What Are Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs)?**\nBefore diving into crypto, let’s understand what a **HELOC** is in traditional finance.\n\nA HELOC is a **revolving loan** (like a credit card) that lets homeowners borrow money up to a certain limit based on the equity in their home. Equity is the difference between what your home is worth and what you still owe on your mortgage. For example:\n- If your home is worth **$500,000** and you owe **$300,000** on your mortgage, your equity is **$200,000**.\n- A bank might approve you for a HELOC worth **$100,000** (half your equity), meaning you can borrow up to that amount.\n\nYou **don’t get all the money at once**—instead, you can withdraw funds as needed (up to the limit) and pay interest only on the amount you borrow. HELOCs are popular because they offer **flexibility**—you can use the money for home improvements, debt consolidation, or emergencies without selling your property.\n\nHowever, HELOCs have downsides:\n- **Bank dependency** – You need a good credit score and proof of income to qualify.\n- **Interest rate fluctuations** – If market rates rise, your payments can increase.\n- **Risk of foreclosure** – If you can’t repay, the bank can take your home.\n- **Slow process** – Getting approved can take weeks, and banks often charge fees.\n\nThis is where **crypto-backed HELOCs** come in—they aim to make the process faster, more accessible, and less reliant on traditional banks.\n\n---\n\n### **Background: What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?**\nDeFi is a **blockchain-based alternative to traditional banking**. Instead of relying on banks, governments, or financial institutions, it uses **smart contracts** (self-executing code on a blockchain) to handle loans, savings, trading, and other financial services.\n\nKey features of DeFi:\n1. **No middlemen (banks, brokers, etc.)** – Users interact directly with protocols.\n2. **Permissionless** – Anyone with an internet connection can use it (no credit checks).\n3. **Transparent** – All transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain).\n4. **Programmable** – Smart contracts can enforce rules (e.g., \"only lend if collateral is 150% of the loan\").\n5. **24/7 access** – Unlike banks with operating hours, DeFi works anytime.\n\n**Figure Technologies** is one of the companies leading this movement. Founded in 2017 by **Eli Boren** and **Dan Steinberg**, Figure specializes in **crypto-backed lending**, where users can take out loans by locking up Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets as collateral. The company has raised over **$200 million** from investors and is known for offering **instant, bank-like loans** without credit checks.\n\nOther major players in DeFi lending include:\n- **MakerDAO** – The pioneering protocol that introduced **Dai**, a stablecoin backed by crypto collateral.\n- **Aave** – A lending platform where users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against them.\n- **Compound** – Another DeFi protocol allowing algorithmic interest rates on loans.\n\nThese platforms show that **crypto collateral is already being used for loans**, but most are for short-term cash needs. FIGR_HELOC (if it exists) may be trying to **extend this idea to real estate**, allowing homeowners to borrow against their property using",

      "title": "Strategy Will Buy Bitcoin 'Forever', Says Michael Saylor—Even With $5 Billion Paper Loss",
      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Article: \"Strategy Will Buy Bitcoin 'Forever,' Says Michael Saylor—Even With $5 Billion Paper Loss\"**\n\nIn late 2022, a well-known tech executive named **Michael Saylor** made headlines when he announced that his company, **MicroStrategy (MSTR)**, would continue buying **Bitcoin (BTC)** even if its value dropped by billions of dollars. This statement was surprising because Bitcoin had recently fallen to its lowest price in years, causing many investors to panic and sell their holdings. At the time, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments were showing a **$5 billion paper loss**—meaning the value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings had decreased by that much compared to when they were purchased. Despite this, Saylor remained confident in Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Let’s break down what this means, why it matters, and the key players and technologies involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Michael Saylor?**\nMichael Saylor is the **CEO of MicroStrategy**, a publicly traded company that specializes in **business intelligence software**—tools that help organizations analyze data to make better decisions. Before Bitcoin, Saylor was not a well-known figure in finance, but his aggressive adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate asset changed that.\n\nIn **2020**, when Bitcoin was still under $10,000, MicroStrategy made a bold move: it bought **$250 million worth of Bitcoin**, arguing that the cryptocurrency would be a better long-term store of value than traditional assets like cash or gold. Since then, the company has continued purchasing Bitcoin, even when its price was rising. By **2022**, MicroStrategy had accumulated over **175,000 BTC**, making it one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world.\n\nSaylor is also a strong advocate for Bitcoin, often tweeting about its benefits and criticizing traditional financial systems. He believes that Bitcoin is a **hedge against inflation**, meaning it protects investors when the value of money (like the U.S. dollar) decreases over time. His stance has made him a polarizing figure—some see him as a visionary, while others think his Bitcoin strategy is risky.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is MicroStrategy?**\nMicroStrategy is a **software company** founded in **1989** by **Sanjeev Bikchandani** and **Michael Saylor**. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions by providing tools for data analysis, reporting, and visualization. For example, a company might use MicroStrategy’s software to track sales trends, customer behavior, or financial performance in real time.\n\nOver the years, MicroStrategy has grown into a **multi-billion-dollar company**, though its stock price has fluctuated. In recent years, the company has shifted its focus from software to **Bitcoin investments**, which has been controversial. While some investors support the move, others worry that MicroStrategy is tying its future to a volatile asset rather than its core business.\n\nThe company’s Bitcoin strategy involves:\n1. **Buying Bitcoin** – MicroStrategy has spent over **$1 billion** on Bitcoin purchases, even when the price was high.\n2. **Holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset** – Instead of keeping cash in the bank, MicroStrategy stores much of its value in Bitcoin, similar to how some companies hold gold.\n3. **Allowing shareholders to redeem Bitcoin for cash** – MicroStrategy lets its investors exchange their shares for Bitcoin, which is unusual for a traditional company.\n\nThis approach is different from most companies, which usually keep their money in **bonds, stocks, or cash** rather than a risky asset like Bitcoin.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin?**\nBitcoin is the **world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency**, created in **2009** by an unknown person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. It operates without a central authority like a bank or government, instead relying on a **peer-to-peer network** where transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the **blockchain**.\n\n#### **Key Features of Bitcoin:**\n- **Decentralized** – No single entity controls Bitcoin. Instead, it is managed by a global network of computers.\n- **Limited Supply** – Only **21 million Bitcoins** will ever exist, making it scarce like gold. This scarcity is one reason why some believe Bitcoin will hold its value over time.\n- **Digital & Borderless** – Bitcoin is purely digital and can be sent anywhere in the world without needing a bank.\n- **Volatile** – Bitcoin’s price swings dramatically, sometimes losing or gaining **20% in a single day**. This makes it risky but also potentially profitable.\n- **Used for Payments & Investments** – Some people use Bitcoin to buy goods and services, while others see it as a long-term investment, like digital gold.\n\n#### **How Bitcoin Works (Simplified):**\nWhen someone sends Bitcoin, the transaction is verified by **miners**—people who use powerful computers to solve complex math problems. Once verified, the transaction is added to the **blockchain**, a digital record that is nearly impossible to alter. This process ensures security and transparency.\n\nBitcoin’s price depends on **supply and demand**. If more people want to buy Bitcoin than sell it, the price goes up. If the opposite happens, the price drops. Unlike traditional money, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, which some argue makes it a better store of value in the long run.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Did MicroStrategy Buy Bitcoin?**\nMicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy was partly inspired by **Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation**. Inflation occurs when the value of money decreases—meaning you need more dollars to buy",
      "full_text": "Strategy Will Buy Bitcoin 'Forever', Says Michael Saylor—Even With $5 Billion Paper Loss Strategy chairman and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor says the firm will buy the top crypto asset “forever,” despite its paper losses now topping $5 billion on its BTC purchases. The largest crypto treasury vehicle spent another $90 million last week on BTC amid a 8% drawdown in the price of Bitcoin, bringing its stash to 714,644 BTC, or about $49 billion worth. The total haul is now worth around $5.1 billion less than the firm paid for it, though, as Bitcoin changes hands around $68,829. But Saylor is unfazed. “We’re not going to be selling. We’re going to be buying Bitcoin,” he said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. “I expect we’ll be buying Bitcoin every quarter, forever.” BTC has fallen 45% from its October all-time high of $126,080, leading some to question at what point Strategy—which owns around 3.4% percent of the Bitcoin supply—may be forced to liquidate assets to service debt or pay its dividends. Saylor called the concerns “unfounded,” noting that his firm has 2.5 years of debt and dividend payments coverage held in a cash reserve. In December, it unveiled a new $1.44 billion USD Reserve to help pay its dividends without touching its Bitcoin holdings and it has since added to that reserve via the issuance of common stock, extending its buffer. Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company, announced Monday that it bought even more BTC last week even as its nearly $50 billion stash remains underwater following last week's crypto market plunge.\nThe firm purchased an additional 1,142 Bitcoin last week, currently valued around $79.3 million worth—though that purchase has already lost value. Strategy purchased the coins for approximately $90 million in total, with a cost basis of $78,815 per coin. Bitcoin was recently trading at $... Yet predictors on Myriad aren’t certain the firm will escape the year without hitting the sell button. As of Thursday, predictors give the firm around a 28% chance of selling BTC before the end of 2026, though that mark is down around 7% in the last seven days as Bitcoin rebounded from its recent lows near $60,000. “If Bitcoin falls 90% for the next four years, we’ll refinance the debt. We’ll just roll it forward,” he said. “You’re at $68,000 right now. It literally has to fall to $8,000, and then we’ll just refinance the debt.” “If you think it’s going to zero, then we’ll deal with that,” he added. “But I don’t think it’s going to zero, and I don’t think it’s going to $8,000 either.” Shares in the firm (MSTR), which Saylor likened to “amplified Bitcoin,” are down around 2.7% in trading on Tuesday and now down nearly 66% in the last six months, changing hands recently around $134.58.

      "title": "FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Requests New Trial After Firing Attorney",
      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Requests New Trial After Firing Attorney: A Simple Explanation**\n\nIn October 2022, one of the biggest scandals in the world of cryptocurrency unfolded when **FTX**, a major crypto exchange, collapsed after being accused of fraud and mismanagement. The company’s founder, **Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)**, was once seen as a rising star in the industry—a young, billionaire-like figure who seemed to have it all. But his downfall was swift and dramatic, leaving many people stunned. Now, nearly two years later, SBF is back in the news because he has asked for a **new trial** after firing his legal team. To understand why this matters, let’s break down the story, the key players involved, the technology behind FTX, and what it all means for the future of crypto.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Was FTX, and What Happened?**\n\nFTX was a **cryptocurrency exchange**, meaning it was a platform where people could buy, sell, and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. Unlike traditional stock markets, which are regulated by governments, crypto exchanges operate mostly independently, relying on trust and technology to keep transactions secure. FTX was particularly popular among traders who wanted to bet on the prices of crypto assets, speculate on future movements, or even trade complex financial products using **derivatives** (a type of contract whose value depends on another asset, like stocks or commodities).\n\nAt its peak, FTX was one of the **largest crypto exchanges** in the world, handling billions of dollars in trades. It was backed by powerful investors, including **BlackRock, Sequoia Capital, and Binance** (another major crypto company). SBF, its founder, was known for his **pro-crypto activism**, donating millions to political campaigns and promoting cryptocurrency as a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional finance. He also founded **Alameda Research**, a crypto trading firm closely connected to FTX.\n\nBut in late 2022, everything fell apart. A news report revealed that **Alameda Research had borrowed massive amounts of money from FTX’s customers** without proper safeguards. This was a major red flag because, in finance, companies are supposed to keep customer funds separate from their own operations. When FTX’s customers tried to withdraw their money, they found that the exchange **didn’t have enough assets to cover the withdrawals**—a situation known as a **\"bank run.\"** Within days, FTX filed for **bankruptcy**, and its assets were frozen. The collapse sent shockwaves through the crypto world, with many investors losing their life savings.\n\nSBF was **arrested** in December 2022 and charged with **fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy** by U.S. authorities. His trial began in October 2023, and in November, a jury found him **guilty on all seven counts**. He was sentenced to **25 years in prison** in May 2024, which he is now appealing. Recently, he announced that he is **requesting a new trial** after firing his legal team, claiming that his previous lawyers were **too aggressive** and that he wants a fresh start with a different defense strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is Sam Bankman-Fried?**\n\nSam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was born in 1992 and grew up in a wealthy family in California. His father, **Joseph Bankman**, is a well-known **tax law professor** at Stanford, and his mother, **Barbara Fried**, is a former federal prosecutor. SBF studied physics at MIT and later law at Stanford, where he was influenced by his father’s work in **game theory** (a branch of mathematics that studies decision-making) and **effective altruism** (a philosophy that encourages using resources to maximize good outcomes).\n\nIn 2017, SBF founded **Alameda Research**, a trading firm that focused on **arbitrage** (buying an asset in one place and selling it in another to make a profit). He then launched **FTX** in 2019, which quickly became a major player in the crypto industry. SBF was known for his **charisma**, often appearing in interviews, donating to political causes, and even writing a book (*The FTX Manifesto*) about his vision for cryptocurrency and how it could replace traditional finance.\n\nDespite his intelligence and success, SBF was also criticized for his **reckless spending**, **lack of transparency**, and **overconfidence** in his own company. He lived in a **luxury penthouse**, bought a **$27 million Bahamas mansion**, and reportedly **partied heavily** while his firm was facing financial troubles. Many saw this as a sign that he wasn’t properly managing the risks of his business.\n\nWhen FTX collapsed, it became clear that SBF had **mixed customer funds with Alameda’s own money**, used FTX’s assets as collateral for risky bets, and **lied to investors** about the company’s financial health. These actions violated basic trust and legal standards, leading to his arrest and trial.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the Technology Behind FTX?**\n\nFTX didn’t invent any groundbreaking technology like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but it relied on several key crypto tools to operate:\n\n1. **Cryptocurrency Exchanges (CEXs)** – FTX was a **centralized exchange**, meaning it held control over users’ funds. Unlike **decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**, which let users trade directly without a middleman, FTX stored customers’ crypto in its own wallets. This made it vulnerable",
      "full_text": "FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Requests New Trial After Firing Attorney Convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried formally requested a new trial in Manhattan on Tuesday, days after firing his attorney. The disgraced FTX founder is currently representing himself. Bankman-Fried had his mother, Stanford Law ethics professor Barbara Fried, file the motion for a new trial on his behalf. The filing, first reported by Inner City Press , requests a new trial under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. That rule allows any defendant to request a new trial within three years of receiving a guilty verdict, if the defendant claims to have discovered new evidence in their case. Requests for a new trial for any reason besides newly discovered evidence must be filed within 14 days of receiving a guilty verdict. Bankman-Fried was found guilty by a Manhattan jury over two years ago on seven fraud and conspiracy charges. He is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the implosion of crypto exchange FTX—which was valued at $32 billion at the time of its 2022 collapse—and the misappropriation of $10 billion worth of customer funds. In 2024, Bankman-Fried appealed his conviction, claiming he was “presumed guilty” by all involved in the case, including the media, prosecutors, the judge, and the FTX debtor estate. On Friday, the crypto founder fired his appellate lawyer, Jason Driscoll, according to court filings. It’s unclear what, if any, new evidence Bankman-Fried may have discovered in his case that could potentially lead to a jury clearing his name. The entrepreneur has made several posts on X in recent weeks (via a proxy), focused primarily on alleging he was the victim of “lawfare” directed at the crypto industry by the Biden administration. Bankman-Fried has attempted to align himself with President Donald Trump since Trump’s re-election, claiming both men were accused of “bogus charges” by their political enemies. During Bankman-Fried’s 2023 trial, federal prosecutors disclosed a document in which the FTX founder considered “com[ing] out as a Republican” as a means to avoid culpability. The strategy has not proven successful thus far. Trump told the New York Times last month that he has no intention of pardoning Bankman-Fried. The CFTC office widely regarded as the regulator’s “top cop” has been reduced to non-existence—at the same time the Trump administration has sought to put the shrinking agency in charge of crypto and the exploding prediction market sector.\nThe CFTC’s flagship Chicago office—which handles the agency’s most complex enforcement actions, and once employed 20 enforcement attorneys—had been slashed down to just a single enforcement lawyer, according to a new Barron’s report citing sources familiar wit...

      "title": "Crypto Exchange Blockchain.com Secures FCA Registration in UK",
      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Crypto News: Blockchain.com’s FCA Registration in the UK**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, where regulations are often unclear and changing, a recent development has caught the attention of investors and industry observers: **Blockchain.com**, one of the largest crypto exchange platforms, has secured **registration with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**. This means the company can now legally operate as a **cryptoasset business** in the country under stricter financial rules. To understand why this news is significant, it’s helpful to break it down into simpler parts—explaining what Blockchain.com does, what the FCA is, how crypto regulations work in the UK, and why this matters for the industry.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Blockchain.com?**\n\nBlockchain.com is a **cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service** that allows users to buy, sell, trade, and store digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others. The company was founded in **2011** by **Ben Reeves** and **Nicolas Cary**, making it one of the oldest and most well-known names in crypto. Originally, it started as a **Bitcoin blockchain explorer**—a tool that lets people track transactions on the Bitcoin network—but over time, it expanded into a full-fledged exchange where users could trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nToday, Blockchain.com operates in multiple countries, including the **U.S., Europe, and the UK**, and serves millions of users. It provides **wallet services** (where people store their crypto) and **exchange services** (where they trade one digital asset for another). The company has also been involved in **staking services**, which allow users to earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies in a supported wallet.\n\nUnlike some newer exchanges, Blockchain.com has a strong reputation for security and reliability. It has survived several major industry shifts, including the rise and fall of different crypto projects, and has maintained a presence even as competition grew. However, its regulatory status has been a point of discussion, especially in countries like the UK where crypto rules are becoming more defined.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the FCA?**\n\nThe **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** is the UK’s main financial regulator. It oversees banks, investment firms, and other financial services to ensure they follow the law, protect consumers, and maintain market stability. The FCA was created in **2013** as part of the UK government’s efforts to regulate financial markets more effectively after the **2008 financial crisis**.\n\nBefore the FCA, crypto exchanges in the UK operated in a **gray area**—neither fully banned nor completely legal. Many exchanges, including Blockchain.com, provided services without explicit permission from regulators. However, in **2020**, the UK government introduced new rules requiring crypto businesses to register with the FCA if they wanted to offer certain services, such as:\n- **Exchanging crypto for traditional money (fiat currencies like pounds or euros)**\n- **Transferring crypto between wallets**\n- **Storing or managing crypto on behalf of others (custody services)**\n\nThe FCA does **not** regulate all crypto activities—it focuses on businesses that deal with **financial services**, meaning simple peer-to-peer (P2P) trading (where two people exchange crypto directly without a middleman) is still outside its scope. The registration process involves **know-your-customer (KYC) checks**, financial security reviews, and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Does Blockchain.com’s FCA Registration Matter?**\n\n#### **1. Increased Trust for Users**\nFor many people, especially beginners, using a **regulated exchange** feels safer than one that operates without oversight. The FCA registration means Blockchain.com must follow **strict rules**, such as:\n- **Verifying user identities** (to prevent fraud and money laundering)\n- **Holding funds securely** (to protect against hacks or losses)\n- **Reporting suspicious transactions** (to authorities)\n\nThis reduces the risk of users losing money due to **scams, hacking, or poor security practices**. While Blockchain.com was already a trusted platform, this official recognition may encourage more users in the UK to feel confident about storing and trading their crypto there.\n\n#### **2. Legal Clarity for the Company**\nBefore this registration, Blockchain.com was operating in the UK under an **unofficial status**, which could have led to legal complications. Some countries have **banned crypto exchanges** entirely, while others have imposed heavy fines or forced them to shut down. By registering with the FCA, Blockchain.com is **officially compliant** with UK laws, meaning it can continue operating without fear of sudden bans or penalties.\n\nThis is particularly important because the **UK government has been tightening crypto regulations**. In **2023**, the FCA issued a warning that **unregistered crypto firms** could be shut down, and some companies (like **Binance**, another major exchange) were already facing legal action for operating without proper licenses. Blockchain.com’s registration shows it is **proactively adapting** to these new rules.\n\n#### **3. Competition and Market Stability**\nThe UK is becoming a **major hub for crypto regulation**, with more companies applying for FCA licenses. Blockchain.com’s registration puts it in the same category as **Kraken, Coinbase, and others** that have already registered. This means:\n- **More competition** for other exchanges, which may lead to better services or lower fees.\n- **A more stable market** because regulated exchanges are less likely to engage in risky behavior (like hiding financial problems or allowing illegal trading).\n\nHowever, some smaller or less-established exchanges might struggle to meet FCA requirements",

Blockchain.com can now provide brokerage, custody, and institutional services under one of the world's strictest regulatory frameworks. For users, this means more protection and oversight of their funds. Founded in the UK in 2011, Blockchain.com has processed over $1.2 trillion in crypto transactions and served 90 million wallets globally. The company started in York before moving to London, with the firm's CEO Peter Smith noting in a press release that, \"We've been part of the UK's tech landscape for over a decade.\" The company didn't immediately respond to a request from Decrypt on whether it would pursue licenses in other regions. The UK registration follows Blockchain.com's MiCA license last year , which allows operations across all 30 European Economic Area countries. Together, these approvals position the company to serve major regulated markets. The timing is strategic, with the UK developing a comprehensive crypto regulatory regime set to launch in 2027.

      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **Understanding Google’s Warning About North Korean AI-Powered Cyberattacks on Crypto and DeFi**\n\nIn early 2024, Google’s **Threat Analysis Group (TAG)** issued a warning about a cyberattack campaign linked to **North Korea’s Lazarus Group**, a notorious hacking collective. The group, known for targeting financial institutions, governments, and tech companies, has now shifted its focus to **cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi)** projects. Google’s report revealed that Lazarus is using **AI-powered tools** to automate parts of the hacking process, making their attacks more efficient and harder to detect. This news is significant because it shows how cybercriminals are evolving their methods to exploit weaknesses in digital finance—an industry already facing high levels of fraud and theft.\n\nTo understand why this matters, we’ll break down the key elements: **who Lazarus is, what cryptocurrency and DeFi are, how AI is being used in these attacks, and why this is dangerous for investors, users, and the broader financial system.**\n\n---\n\n### **Who Is the Lazarus Group?**\n\nThe **Lazarus Group** is a state-sponsored hacking team believed to be operating under the direction of **North Korea’s government**. First identified in 2014, it was linked to a massive cyberattack on **Sony Pictures Entertainment**, where hackers leaked private data, deleted files, and caused widespread disruption. The attack was widely attributed to North Korea as retaliation for a comedy film that mocked its leader, **Kim Jong-un**.\n\nSince then, Lazarus has been responsible for some of the largest **cyber heists in history**, often targeting banks, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency exchanges. Their most famous operation was the **2016 Bangladesh Bank heist**, where they stole **$81 million** using sophisticated malware. They also played a role in the **2018 WannaCry ransomware attack**, which crippled hospitals, businesses, and governments worldwide by encrypting files and demanding Bitcoin payments.\n\nUnlike typical hackers who work for personal gain, Lazarus is suspected of operating for **political and financial motives**, with stolen funds likely being used to support North Korea’s regime. The U.S. Treasury has even **sanctioned Lazarus** (officially known as **APT38**), accusing them of funding North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs through cybercrime.\n\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group is one of the many cybersecurity firms monitoring Lazarus. TAG specializes in tracking **state-backed hackers** and warning companies about emerging threats. Their reports are taken seriously because Google has deep insight into how attackers move across the internet, including tracking phishing emails, malware distribution, and other cybercrime tactics.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Cryptocurrency and DeFi?**\n\nBefore diving into the attack, it’s important to understand what **cryptocurrency** and **DeFi** are, since they’re the main targets in this campaign.\n\n#### **Cryptocurrency (Crypto)**\nCryptocurrency is a type of **digital money** that uses **cryptography (advanced math and coding)** to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Unlike traditional money, which is regulated by banks and governments, crypto operates on **decentralized networks** called **blockchains**. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are among the most well-known cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of crypto is **pseudonymity**—transactions are recorded on a public ledger, but users aren’t directly identified by their real names. Instead, they use **wallet addresses**, which are long strings of numbers and letters. While this provides privacy, it also makes crypto an attractive target for criminals, as stolen funds can be moved without easily traceable bank records.\n\n#### **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**\nDeFi is a **newer financial system** built on blockchain technology, designed to eliminate the need for traditional banks or intermediaries. Instead of relying on centralized institutions like banks or stock exchanges, DeFi uses **smart contracts**—self-executing digital agreements written in code—to automate loans, trading, savings, and other financial services.\n\nFor example:\n- **Uniswap** and **PancakeSwap** are DeFi platforms that allow users to **trade cryptocurrencies directly without a middleman**.\n- **Aave** and **Compound** are **lending protocols** where users can deposit crypto to earn interest or borrow funds by using crypto as collateral.\n- **Stablecoins** (like **USDT or DAI**) are crypto tokens pegged to real-world assets (such as the U.S. dollar) to avoid extreme price swings.\n\nDeFi has grown rapidly, with billions of dollars locked into these platforms. However, because DeFi is **open-source and permissionless**, anyone—including hackers—can examine its code for vulnerabilities. If a flaw is found, attackers can exploit it to **steal funds, manipulate prices, or drain liquidity** from a protocol.\n\n#### **Why Are Crypto and DeFi Vulnerable to Attacks?**\nCrypto and DeFi are attractive targets because:\n1. **High Profits** – Successful hacks can yield millions in stolen assets.\n2. **Irreversible Transactions** – Unlike bank transfers, crypto transactions are **permanent**; if funds are stolen, they’re often gone forever.\n3. **Smart Contract Risks** – DeFi relies on code, and even small bugs can lead to massive losses (e.g., the **$600 million Poly Network hack** in 2021).\n4. **Anonymity** – While not fully anonymous, crypto transactions are harder to trace than traditional financial crimes.\n",
      "full_text": "Google Warns of AI-Powered North Korean Malware Campaign Targeting Crypto, DeFi Google’s security team at Mandiant has warned that North Korean hackers are incorporating artificial intelligence–generated deepfakes into fake video meetings as part of increasingly sophisticated attacks against crypto companies, according to a report released Monday. Mandiant said it recently investigated an intrusion at a fintech company that it attributes to UNC1069, or \"CryptoCore\", a threat actor linked with high confidence to North Korea. The attack used a compromised Telegram account, a spoofed Zoom meeting, and a so-called ClickFix technique to trick the victim into running malicious commands. Investigators also found evidence that AI-generated video was used to deceive the target during the fake meeting. “Mandiant has observed UNC1069 employing these techniques to target both corporate entities and individuals within the cryptocurrency industry, including software firms and their developers, as well as venture capital firms and their employees or executives,” the report said. The warning comes as North Korea’s cryptocurrency cryptocurrency thefts continue to grow in scale. In mid-December, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said North Korean hackers stole $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency in 2025, a 51% increase from the year before. The total amount stolen by DPRK-linked actors now stands at roughly $6.75 billion, even as the number of attacks has declined. The findings highlight a broader shift in how state-linked cybercriminals are operating. Rather than relying on mass phishing campaigns, CryptoCore and similar groups are focusing on highly tailored attacks that exploit trust in routine digital interactions, such as calendar invites and video calls. In this way, North Korea is achieving larger thefts through fewer, more targeted incidents. Hackers from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, also known as the DPRK or North Korea, have stolen $2.02 billion worth of crypto so far in 2025, a Chainalysis report revealed Thursday.\nThis represents a 51% increase from last year’s figure, and is the largest year on record for DPRK-related crypto theft. As a whole, crypto has seen $3.4 billion in thefts this year, the report says, meaning that DPRK attacks account for 59% of these stolen funds.\nChainalysis believes that the data shows a... According to Mandiant, the attack began when the victim was contacted on Telegram by what appeared to be a known cryptocurrency executive whose account had already been compromised. After building rapport, the attacker sent a Calendly link for a 30-minute meeting that directed the victim to a fake Zoom call hosted on the group’s own infrastructure. During the call, the victim reported seeing what appeared to be a deepfake video of a well-known crypto CEO. Once the meeting began, the attackers claimed there were audio problems and instructed the victim to run “troubleshooting” commands, a ClickFix technique that ultimately triggered the malware infection. Forensic analysis later identified seven distinct malware families on the victim’s system, deployed in an apparent attempt to harvest credentials, browser data and session tokens for financial theft and future impersonation. Fraser Edwards, co-founder and CEO of decentralized identity firm cheqd, said the attack reflects a pattern he is seeing repeatedly against people whose jobs depend on remote meetings and rapid coordination. “The effectiveness of this approach comes from how little has to look unusual,” Edwards said. “The sender is familiar. The meeting format is routine. There is no malware attachment or obvious exploit. Trust is leveraged before any technical defence has a chance to intervene.” Edwards said deepfake video is typically introduced at escalation points, such as live calls, where seeing a familiar face can override doubts created by unexpected requests or technical issues. “Seeing what appears to be a real person on camera is often enough to override doubt created by an unexpected request or technical issue. The goal is not prolonged interaction, but just enough realism to move the victim to the next step,” he said. He added that AI is now being used to support impersonation outside of live calls. “It is used to draft messages, correct tone of voice, and mirror the way someone normally communicates with colleagues or friends. That makes routine messages harder to question and reduces the chance that a recipient pauses long enough to verify the interaction,” he explained. Edwards warned the risk will increase as AI agents are introduced into everyday communication and decision-making. “Agents can send messages, schedule calls, and act on behalf of users at machine speed. If those systems are abused or compromised, deepfake audio or video can be deployed automatically, turning impersonation from a manual effort into a scalable process,” he said. It's \"unrealistic\" to expect most users to know how to spot a deepfake, E"

      "title": "CFTC's 'Top Cop' Legal Team Eliminated Amid Embrace of Crypto, Prediction Markets: Report",
      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "Here’s a simple, educational breakdown of the crypto news article titled *\"CFTC’s 'Top Cop' Legal Team Eliminated Amid Embrace of Crypto, Prediction Markets: Report\"*:\n\n---\n\n### **What the Article Is About**\nThe U.S. government’s **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)**—a financial regulator that oversees markets like futures, derivatives, and certain crypto assets—has reportedly dismantled its **\"Virtual Markets Task Force\"**, a specialized legal team created to crack down on cryptocurrency fraud. This move comes as the CFTC has increasingly focused on regulating crypto-related activities, including **prediction markets** (a type of betting system where people trade on the outcomes of real-world events, like elections or sports). The article suggests the task force was eliminated because the CFTC now believes it’s better to work *with* crypto companies and platforms rather than against them. This shift reflects a growing recognition among regulators that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and that collaboration might be more effective than enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### **Background: What Is the CFTC?**\nThe **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** is a federal agency in the U.S. that regulates financial markets involving **commodities**—like agricultural products (e.g., wheat, corn) or energy (e.g., oil, natural gas). It was established in 1974 after Congress passed the **Commodity Futures Trading Act (CFTA)** to protect investors and ensure fair trading in these markets.\n\nOver time, the CFTC’s role expanded to include **derivatives**—financial contracts whose value depends on an underlying asset (like stocks or bonds). For example, if you bet on whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall in the future, that’s a derivative, and the CFTC could have jurisdiction over it.\n\nIn 2015, the CFTC declared that **Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are commodities**, not currencies. This meant they fell under the CFTC’s oversight rather than the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**, which regulates stocks and securities. The agency has since taken an aggressive stance against fraud, manipulation, and unregistered trading in crypto markets, filing lawsuits against companies like **Bitfinex** and **Binance** for allegedly breaking rules.\n\n---\n\n### **What Was the \"Top Cop\" Legal Team?**\nThe **\"Virtual Markets Task Force\"** was a small but powerful group within the CFTC, often called the **\"Top Cop\"** because it was led by **Gurbir Grewal**, a senior enforcement official known for aggressively pursuing crypto cases. The team was created in 2021 to focus specifically on **fraud, misconduct, and illegal trading in digital asset markets**.\n\nBefore this team existed, the CFTC handled crypto cases like any other financial violation. But Grewal’s task force was unique because it had deep expertise in blockchain technology, crypto trading, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Its goal was to **identify and prosecute bad actors**—people or companies exploiting loopholes, scamming investors, or manipulating markets.\n\nFor example, the team investigated **FTX**, the collapsed crypto exchange, and played a key role in exposing its fraud before the company’s downfall. They also targeted **Bitfinex** for allegedly hiding its financial ties to a bank and **Binance** for operating an unregistered trading platform. These cases made the CFTC a major player in crypto regulation, feared by many in the industry for its tough approach.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the CFTC’s New Approach?**\nThe article suggests that the CFTC is **phasing out the task force** and instead **embracing crypto and prediction markets**. This doesn’t mean the agency is giving up on enforcement—far from it. Instead, it appears to be **shifting from pure crackdowns to more collaboration**.\n\nHere’s what that likely means:\n1. **Regulation Over Enforcement** – The CFTC may now prioritize **creating clear rules** for crypto companies rather than just suing them. This could help prevent fraud by setting standards for transparency, licensing, and compliance.\n2. **Working with the Industry** – Instead of treating crypto firms as outlaws, the agency might be **partnering with them** to ensure they follow the law. For instance, it could work with exchanges to verify that traders are who they claim to be (a process called **know your customer, or KYC**) to prevent money laundering.\n3. **Focus on Prediction Markets** – The CFTC has also shown interest in **prediction markets**, where people trade on the outcomes of events (like elections, sports, or even stock movements). These markets are controversial because they can resemble **gambling**, which is illegal in many forms in the U.S. However, some argue they provide **useful price signals** (like how much people think a stock is worth). The CFTC’s new stance suggests it may be **exploring how to allow these markets while protecting consumers**.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Does This Matter?**\nThis change has several important implications:\n\n#### **1. A Signal That Crypto Is Becoming Mainstream**\nThe CFTC’s decision to **dismantle its anti-crypto task force** sends a message: the agency no longer sees cryptocurrencies as a passing fad but as a **legitimate part of the financial system**. This aligns with other U.S. regulators, like the **SEC**, which has also been **more open to crypto-related businesses** (though still cautious).\n\nFor beginners, this means that **crypto is being taken seriously by the government**, and the rules around it are likely to become clearer—though not necessarily easier. Regulation can be good (it protects investors) but also bad",
      "full_text": "CFTC's 'Top Cop' Legal Team Eliminated Amid Embrace of Crypto, Prediction Markets: Report The CFTC office widely regarded as the regulator’s “top cop” has been reduced to non-existence—at the same time the Trump administration has sought to put the shrinking agency in charge of crypto and the exploding prediction market sector. The CFTC’s flagship Chicago office—which handles the agency’s most complex enforcement actions, and once employed 20 enforcement attorneys—had been slashed down to just a single enforcement lawyer, according to a new Barron’s report citing sources familiar with the office’s moves. On Monday, the final enforcement attorney remaining in the Chicago office resigned, a Barron’s reporter confirmed following the initial publication of the story. That massive reduction—of the key office’s entire litigation team—comes as the CFTC has raced in the last year to absorb the crypto and prediction market industries into its jurisdiction. The same agency leadership responsible for the CFTC’s significant staff reductions has, in the last year, championed the agency’s dominion over the vast majority of the crypto market, and also over the controversial and sprawling realm of sports-dominated prediction market platforms. Caroline Pham, who led the CFTC in 2025 as acting chair, was chiefly responsible for reducing the agency’s total staff by over 21% last year. Pham now works for MoonPay, a crypto company. The world of professional sports was rocked late last week by the biggest betting scandal in recent memory. It happened just as pro leagues and sportsbooks signaled their embrace of the booming prediction market industry, raising questions as to whether the pairing could soon lead to predictable consequences.\nOn Thursday, an FBI operation culminated in the the arrest of an NBA player and a coach for alleged involvement in multiple gambling schemes, including one involving the manipulation of gam... Former CFTC enforcement lawyers let go by the agency said they felt the moves were targeted, given the Chicago office’s particular expertise and key role in securing multi-billion dollar settlements from crypto companies including FTX and Binance . “If I was a different person I would launch a crypto scam right now, because there’s no cops on the beat,” one of the laid-off lawyers, a chief trial attorney who worked at the CFTC for 26 years, told Barron’s . Experts recently told Decrypt the CFTC, further, is woefully unequipped to investigate potential insider trading on the thousands of prediction markets (most sports-related) it now wants to regulate. The CFTC did not immediately respond to Decrypt ’s request for comment on this story. During a generally friendly Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, CFTC Chair nominee Mike Selig refused to say the agency needs more resources, even as the CFTC is poised to take on new duties in regulating the crypto market. And while not directly pushing back on the idea of non-Republican commissioners at the CFTC, as required by law, Selig would not commit to advocating for their inclusion.\nSelig, who currently serves as chief counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force, received a warm receptio... The reductions in the Chicago office’s legal staff, paired with the Trump CFTC’s new priorities, have markedly reduced the monetary relief secured by the agency via enforcement actions. In fiscal year 2024, the CFTC secured $17.1 billion in monetary relief on behalf of investors. That figure plummeted in 2025 by over 99.9%, to just $9.2 million. During his Senate confirmation hearing in November, the CFTC’s new chair, Mike Selig, refused to commit to saying the agency needs additional resources to regulate crypto and prediction markets. Selig’s resistance was notable, given top Senate Democrats and Republicans voiced support for increased agency funding at the hearing. “I don’t know why it’s hard to say we need more staff,” one senator, Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), told Selig at the time.

      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **Prediction Markets Explained: How They Grew to $63.5 Billion in 2025—and Why Experts Are Worried**\n\nIn early 2023, few people outside of finance and crypto circles had heard of **prediction markets**. But by 2025, these platforms—where users bet on real-world events like elections, sports outcomes, or even stock prices—have exploded in popularity, reaching a total market size of **$63.5 billion**, according to a new report by **CertiK**, a blockchain security and research company. This growth is staggering, especially when you consider that prediction markets were once a niche experiment mostly used by academics and hedge funds. Now, they’re mainstream, with millions of users trading digital assets to speculate on everything from political results to the weather.\n\nBut while the numbers are impressive, CertiK warns that this rapid expansion has created **\"structural strain\"**—meaning the system is under pressure and may not be sustainable in the long run. The report suggests that prediction markets, despite their potential, face serious risks, including **manipulation, lack of regulation, and technological vulnerabilities**. Understanding how these markets work, why they’ve grown so fast, and what CertiK’s concerns mean is important for anyone interested in finance, crypto, or even just how people now bet on the future.\n\n---\n\n### **What Are Prediction Markets?**\n\nPrediction markets are platforms where people trade financial instruments (like stocks, futures, or tokens) based on their expectations of future events. If someone correctly predicts an outcome—say, whether a sports team will win or if a new law will pass—they profit. If they’re wrong, they lose money. These markets are designed to **aggregate collective knowledge** in a way that’s more accurate than individual guesses or traditional polling.\n\nThe idea isn’t new. The first prediction market was created in the **1980s** by **Robin Hanson**, an economist at George Mason University. He proposed the **\"Iowa Electronic Market\"** (IEM), where traders bet on political elections using shares in companies. The market became famous for correctly predicting outcomes like the **2008 U.S. presidential election** and the **2020 U.S. election**—often more accurately than traditional polls. Since then, prediction markets have been used by governments, businesses, and even intelligence agencies to forecast everything from **box office revenues** to **disease outbreaks**.\n\nIn the **2000s**, companies like **Intraday** and **PredictIt** brought prediction markets to the public. These platforms allowed people to trade on political events, scientific discoveries, and even entertainment outcomes (like who would win *American Idol*). However, they were still limited by **legal restrictions** (many prediction markets were banned in the U.S. under gambling laws) and **low participation**, making them more of a curiosity than a major financial tool.\n\nThen came **cryptocurrency and blockchain technology**, which changed everything.\n\n---\n\n### **How Blockchain and Crypto Made Prediction Markets Explode**\n\nBefore blockchain, prediction markets relied on **centralized exchanges**—companies that controlled the trading, kept records, and managed payouts. This meant users had to **trust the platform** to handle their money fairly and pay out winners correctly. If the company was hacked, shut down, or accused of fraud, traders could lose their funds.\n\nBlockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin and Ethereum**, solved this problem by making prediction markets **decentralized**. Instead of a single company running the market, a **network of computers (nodes)** verifies trades, ensures transparency, and automatically settles payouts when an event is resolved. This removes the need for trust in a middleman and makes markets **more secure and open**.\n\nThe most famous **crypto-based prediction market** is **Augur**, launched in **2015** on the Ethereum blockchain. Augur allowed users to create and trade markets on any event, from sports to politics. Unlike traditional prediction markets, it was **fully decentralized**, meaning no single entity could control or censor the markets. However, Augur struggled with **scalability** (slow transaction speeds) and **user adoption**, limiting its growth.\n\nLater, platforms like **Polymarket, Gnosis, and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks** (which provide real-world data to smart contracts) improved the technology. These newer markets use **smart contracts**—self-executing digital agreements—to automatically pay out winners when an event is verified. For example, if a market predicts whether **Elon Musk will tweet a certain phrase**, a smart contract could check his Twitter feed and distribute funds accordingly.\n\nBy **2020–2025**, prediction markets became a **multi-billion-dollar industry**, driven by:\n- **Ethereum’s growth** (which powers many prediction market smart contracts).\n- **Increased adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi)**, where crypto users trade derivatives without banks.\n- **Big events** like U.S. elections, the **2024 Olympics**, and even **AI advancements** (such as whether a certain lab would achieve a breakthrough).\n- **Easier access**—users don’t need to be financial experts; they can bet with just a crypto wallet and some internet knowledge.\n\nThe **$63.5 billion** figure from CertiK likely includes:\n- **Traditional prediction markets** (like those for sports or politics).\n- **Crypto-native markets** (where bets are placed using tokens like ETH or stablecoins).\n- **Corporate and institutional use** (companies using prediction markets internally to forecast risks).\n\n---\n\n### **Why Prediction Markets Matter",
      "full_text": "Prediction Markets Grew 4X to $63.5B in 2025, But Risk Structural Strain: CertiK The surge in prediction markets is masking deeper structural strains, with inflated volumes, fragile security architecture, and state-level regulation increasingly testing whether prices, liquidity, and access can hold up as the sector scales. That’s according to a new report from blockchain security firm CertiK, which said that trading volumes quadrupled in 2025 as activity concentrated around a small group of dominant platforms, even as security and regulatory risks intensified. On-chain prediction markets such as Myriad, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, have rapidly gained traction in recent years, enabling users to bet on the outcomes of events such as the U.S. Presidential election.\nSo what are prediction markets, and how do they differ from conventional prediction markets? Read on to find out.\nWhat are prediction markets?\nPrediction markets have existed in one form or another since the 16th century. They allow users to speculate on the outcome of any fut... Annual trading volume climbed from $15.8 billion in 2024 to about $63.5 billion in 2025, with liquidity consolidating around three platforms: Kalshi, Polymarket, and Opinion. That growth, however, has been heavily driven by incentives and event-driven spikes rather than steady organic demand, raising questions about sustainability once subsidies fade. CertiK cites academic research showing wash trading on Polymarket rose sharply in 2024, peaking near 60% of reported volume as traders farmed incentives through circular trades. While this inflated liquidity metrics, CertiK claimed prices have largely remained reliable, with manipulation affecting market appearance more than forecasting accuracy. To CertiK, the distinction between inflated activity and broken markets comes down to whether artificial trading begins to affect how prices are formed rather than how volume is reported. “The key indicators would be persistent price divergence between platforms on the same event that arbitrage doesn’t close, probability movements without corresponding news or data releases driven by concentrated wallet clusters, and systematic bias in how markets price outcomes relative to actual resolutions,” CertiK told Decrypt in an interview. If prediction markets remain “consistently off by 5-10 points in one direction” and such a pattern “correlates with identifiable whale or wash trading activity” that could be evidence that “fake volume is bleeding into price formation,” CertiK said. Polymarket has filed trademark applications for \"POLY\" and \"$POLY\" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, signaling concrete steps toward launching its long-anticipated native token, even as the prediction market faces mounting regulatory challenges.\nThe filings, submitted Thursday by Polymarket's parent company Blockratize Inc., cover trademark protection for “cryptocurrency services, financial trading platforms, and blockchain-based payment systems.”\nBoth applications describe services for... CertiK maintains it has not seen evidence of wash trading distorting prices at scale on major platforms, with market probabilities remaining broadly reliable even during periods of elevated artificial activity. It cautioned, however, that the data remain limited and that lower-liquidity markets could become more vulnerable as incentive programs draw in more sophisticated traders. Beyond market integrity, CertiK warned that the prediction market sector’s rapid growth has outpaced the maturity of its security architecture, leaving structural weaknesses that become more consequential as platforms scale and attract more users. Hybrid Web2/Web3 designs exist to balance ease of onboarding with on-chain transparency, but combining them “creates exposure to both attack surfaces simultaneously,” CertiK said. In December 2025, attackers exploited a flaw in the authentication flow of Magic Labs, a third-party login service used by Polymarket for email-based access. The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass two-factor authentication and take control of user accounts created through Magic’s email login. The Polymarket incident shows that a failure in authentication can put user funds at risk even when smart contracts are secure, CertiK said. “Addressing this requires treating the full stack as a single security surface, auditing and testing authentication, key management, and settlement together rather than in isolation,” the security firm said. Looking ahead, CertiK said the prediction market sector is entering 2026 at a crossroads, with functioning infrastructure and clearer U.S. federal policy offset by unresolved questions around sustainability and oversight, as prediction market platforms continue to tussle with regulators. A federal judge has temporarily blocked Connecticut from enforcing gambling laws against prediction market Kalshi, ordering state regulators to hold off on any enforcement action while "

      "summary": "### **Explaining the Coinbase Super Bowl Ad Controversy in Simple Terms**\n\nIn early 2024, Coinbase—the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange—made headlines when it aired a commercial during the **Super Bowl**, the biggest annual sports event in the United States. The ad was part of a broader marketing push by the company, but instead of being widely praised, it faced criticism from many people in the crypto industry. To understand why, we need to break down what Coinbase is, why the Super Bowl matters for advertising, and what the backlash was about.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Coinbase?**\n\nCoinbase is a company that allows people to buy, sell, and store **cryptocurrencies** like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others. Think of it like a bank for digital money—users can deposit funds (such as U.S. dollars or euros) and trade them for cryptocurrencies, or vice versa. The platform also provides tools for businesses and developers to interact with blockchain technology, which is the underlying system that powers most cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe company was founded in **2012** by **Brian Armstrong** and **Fred Ehrsam**, two former engineers at a tech startup called **Airbnb**. At the time, Bitcoin was still a niche idea, and Coinbase helped make it more accessible to regular people by offering an easy way to buy and sell digital assets. Over the years, it grew into one of the most well-known names in crypto, handling billions of dollars in transactions and listing hundreds of different cryptocurrencies.\n\nCoinbase operates in multiple countries, including the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but it’s particularly important in the United States because it’s the first major crypto exchange to be registered with the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**, a government agency that regulates financial markets. This registration gave Coinbase more credibility, as it meant the company was following strict rules to protect its users.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is the Super Bowl, and Why Do Companies Advertise There?**\n\nThe **Super Bowl** is the championship game of the **National Football League (NFL)**, the most popular professional football (American football) league in the world. It’s held every year in February and attracts millions of viewers globally. Because so many people watch the game, companies see it as a prime opportunity to advertise their products or services.\n\nA **30-second Super Bowl ad** can cost millions of dollars—sometimes over **$10 million**—because it guarantees massive exposure. Ads during the Super Bowl often go viral, even if they’re not directly related to the game. For example, companies like **Doritos**, **Budweiser**, and **Apple** have used the event to promote everything from snacks to new products.\n\nHowever, Super Bowl ads aren’t just about entertainment. They can also be **political statements**. Some ads have been criticized for being too flashy, misleading, or even offensive. Others have faced backlash for not aligning with the values of certain groups. In the case of Coinbase’s ad, the criticism came from within the **crypto community** itself.\n\n---\n\n### **What Was Coinbase’s Super Bowl Ad About?**\n\nCoinbase’s Super Bowl ad featured a **celebrity**, **Ariana Grande**, singing a song while people in the background danced and celebrated. The ad showed her holding a **Bitcoin (BTC)** and an **Ethereum (ETH)** token, with the text:\n\n> *\"Bitcoin is for the people. Ethereum is for the planet. Coinbase is for everyone.\"*\n\nThe ad also included a **QR code** that viewers could scan to visit Coinbase’s website and learn more about buying cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt first glance, the ad seemed like a fun, high-energy way to introduce Coinbase to a mainstream audience. But many crypto enthusiasts and experts were **not happy** with it. Here’s why:\n\n1. **It Was Seen as Too Mainstream** – The crypto industry has a strong culture of **decentralization** and **anti-establishment** values. Many people in crypto believe that traditional financial institutions (like banks) and big corporations (like Coinbase) don’t truly represent the spirit of crypto, which was originally meant to be a **peer-to-peer (P2P) system** outside of government control. Using a pop star like Ariana Grande in a Super Bowl ad made some feel like Coinbase was trying to **sell out** to mainstream America rather than staying true to crypto’s original ideals.\n\n2. **It Promoted Centralized Custody** – One of the biggest debates in crypto is whether people should **hold their own private keys** (which give them full control over their money) or rely on **exchanges** (like Coinbase) that store keys for them. If an exchange gets hacked or shuts down, users might lose access to their funds. Coinbase’s ad didn’t mention this risk, and some saw it as encouraging people to **trust Coinbase** rather than learning how to **self-custody** their crypto (keeping it in their own wallets).\n\n3. **It Was Too Simplistic** – Crypto is a complex topic, involving **blockchain technology**, **smart contracts**, **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, and more. Many critics argued that Coinbase’s ad made crypto seem like just another **financial product**—something you can buy and sell easily, without explaining the deeper technical or philosophical aspects. This frustrated people who believe crypto should be about **financial freedom**, **transparency**, and **cutting out middlemen** like banks.\n\n4. **It Didn’t Address Key Issues** – In 2023, the crypto industry faced major challenges",

Coinbase was the lone crypto company with a Super Bowl ad . And the crowd... was not entirely on board. Crypto’s Super Bowl presence has shrunk from a multi-company marketing blitz to a single exchange’s sing-along, with Coinbase returning to the big game alone this year, as the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots to win Super Bowl LX.\nFour years after Coinbase brought its viral bouncing QR-code commercial to the “Crypto Bowl,” the exchange aired the only major crypto ad during this year’s Super Bowl broadcast—unlike Super Bowl LVI, which featured celebrity campaigns from multiple f... Coinbase ran a 60-second spot during Super Bowl LX that looked nothing like a typical Super Bowl ad (and “tricked” a lot of viewers). Karaoke-style lyrics from the Backstreet Boys’ 1997 hit “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” scrolled across the screen in lo-fi graphics, mimicking a karaoke bar. Meanwhile, the lyrics were subtly rewritten to weave in Coinbase messaging (\"am I Original… am I Secure… am I for Everyone\"), and the ad closed with a pivot to the Coinbase logo alone on screen. The reaction was immediately polarizing. Multiple videos surfaced on X showing watch party crowds happily singing along to the Backstreet Boys—then audibly booing and groaning the moment Coinbase’s branding appeared on screen. One viral clip showed an entire room go from a full singalong to dead silence in seconds. Coinbase leaned in. When one user called the ad “terrible,” the company’s official X account responded : “If you’re talking about it, it worked. Crypto is for everybody.” Meanwhile, ARK Invest was quite literally selling its Coinbase position. Cathie Wood’s firm dumped over $22M in COIN shares across multiple ETFs on Thursday and Friday. Maybe they saw the ad in advance. 🗣️ What They’re Saying Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO: “Turning 100M+ screens into karaoke, so the whole U.S. (and many around the world) can sing in unison, is an antidote to polarization and just plain fun. Everybody deserves economic freedom.” Cat Ferdon, Coinbase CMO: “We’re really trying to effectively use this as the world’s biggest singalong, to show that crypto isn’t just for techies, but really for anyone who knows the lyrics.” In 2022, crypto companies flooded the Super Bowl —FTX had Larry David, Crypto.com had Matt Damon telling you fortune favors the brave, and Coinbase’s floating QR code crashed its servers with 20 million hits in one minute. Fast forward to 2026 and Coinbase is the only one left standing. But the lone crypto ad isn’t the problem here. The problem is the reaction from retail. From jovial singing and laughing to loud boos at the site of Coinbase and/or crypto? That’s not a great sign for retail coming back any time soon. Crypto clearly has an image problem with retail, one likely made worse during the Trump administration (and the Trump meme coin debacle). And with gold & silver + several sectors of the stock market outperforming crypto in 2025, there’s a real question out there as to why retail should care / come back to crypto. Unfortunately, as strong of a value prop as “economic freedom” delivers, it’s not one that’s resonating with mainstream in the U.S. And why would it? This cohort isn’t being persecuted and doesn’t need that use case (and let’s hope it doesn’t ever). It seems we need to find the new messaging beyond economic freedom to get retail back on. And solve crypto’s branding problem once and for all… Polymarket went on the offensive Monday in the ongoing battle of prediction markets against Massachusetts regulators, claiming in a federal lawsuit that the state lacks authority to regulate its platform.\nLast month, a Massachusetts judge gave a green light to regulators seeking to temporarily ban Polymarket rival Kalshi from offering sports markets in the state.

      "summary": "**Where Next for Bitcoin? The Bull and Bear Case – A Beginner’s Guide**\n\nBitcoin, the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has been around for over a decade, but it remains one of the most debated and unpredictable assets in finance. Unlike traditional money—like the U.S. dollar or the euro—Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no government or bank controls it. Instead, it relies on a network of computers (called \"nodes\") and a technology called blockchain to verify transactions and maintain its value. Over the years, Bitcoin has seen dramatic price swings, from near-zero in its early days to over $60,000 in 2021, followed by sharp drops. Recently, Bitcoin has been making headlines again, with some experts predicting a bright future and others warning of potential risks. To understand where Bitcoin might be heading, it’s helpful to break down the arguments of both the \"bulls\" (those who think prices will rise) and the \"bears\" (those who believe prices will fall). This article explains the basics of Bitcoin, the key players involved, the technology behind it, and why its future matters to investors, businesses, and even governments.\n\n---\n\n### **What Is Bitcoin? A Quick Overview**\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) using the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**. The idea was introduced in a whitepaper titled *\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\"* which proposed a new way to transfer money without needing banks or other middlemen. At its core, Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a blockchain—a public ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.\n\nThe blockchain ensures that Bitcoin transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, the transaction is added to a \"block,\" which is then linked to the previous block in a chain. This system prevents fraud because altering past transactions would require changing every subsequent block, which is nearly impossible due to the sheer number of computers involved.\n\nBitcoin also has a **fixed supply**, meaning only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. This is different from traditional currencies, which governments can print more of as needed. The limited supply is one reason why some people compare Bitcoin to **gold**—a rare, finite asset that holds value over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Players in Bitcoin’s Story**\nTo understand Bitcoin’s future, it’s important to know who the major players are:\n\n1. **Satoshi Nakamoto** – The mysterious founder of Bitcoin. No one knows their real identity, but they disappeared from the project in 2010, leaving behind a legacy of innovation. Their whitepaper laid the foundation for all cryptocurrencies that followed.\n\n2. **Bitcoin Miners** – These are individuals or companies that use powerful computers to solve complex math problems, which help secure the network and create new Bitcoins. Mining is how Bitcoin is introduced into circulation, and miners earn fees for processing transactions. However, the process is energy-intensive, and many critics argue it’s not environmentally friendly.\n\n3. **Bitcoin Exchanges** – Platforms like **Coinbase**, **Binance**, and **Kraken** allow people to buy and sell Bitcoin using traditional money (like dollars) or other cryptocurrencies. These exchanges are important because they provide liquidity (the ability to easily convert Bitcoin into cash or other assets), but they have also been targets of hacking and regulatory scrutiny.\n\n4. **Institutional Investors** – Large financial firms, such as **MicroStrategy**, **Tesla**, and **BlackRock**, have started buying Bitcoin as part of their investment portfolios. Some see this as a sign that Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream, while others worry that big players could manipulate the market.\n\n5. **Regulators** – Governments and financial authorities, like the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** or the **European Central Bank (ECB)**, are still figuring out how to treat Bitcoin. Some countries, like **El Salvador**, have adopted it as legal tender, while others, like **China**, have banned it entirely. The SEC has also been strict about crypto companies, forcing some to stop trading or pay fines.\n\n6. **Developers and Open-Source Community** – Bitcoin is maintained by a group of programmers who work on improving its security and efficiency. Unlike traditional financial systems, Bitcoin’s code is open for anyone to review, which helps prevent corruption but also means changes happen slowly.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does the Technology Behind Bitcoin Mean?**\nBitcoin’s technology is built on **three main ideas**:\n\n1. **Decentralization** – No single entity (like a bank or government) controls Bitcoin. Instead, it runs on a global network of computers. This makes it resistant to censorship and manipulation but also harder to regulate.\n\n2. **Blockchain** – The blockchain is a digital record of all Bitcoin transactions. It’s stored across thousands of computers worldwide, so no one can erase or change past data without consensus from the network. This transparency is both a strength (preventing fraud) and a weakness (making privacy harder).\n\n3. **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining** – To add a new block to the chain, miners must solve a complex mathematical puzzle. This process requires a lot of computing power and electricity, making it expensive but secure. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block and receives newly minted Bitcoins as a reward. This system is energy-heavy, which has led to debates about its sustainability.\n\n#### **How Bitcoin Works in Practice**\nWhen you send Bitcoin to someone, the transaction isn’t immediately confirmed. Instead, it’s broadcast to the network, where miners compete",
      "full_text": "Where Next for Bitcoin? The Bull and Bear Case Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently caught in a high-stakes tug-of-war between technical gravity and a potential institutional \"pain trade.\" After a sharp slide from its October 2025 peak of $126,210, Bitcoin has shed nearly 45% of its value, stabilizing around $68,500, per CoinGecko data . For many, the question is no longer if the market has changed, but where the new floor resides as the asset matures into a macro-sensitive heavyweight. Analysts are weighing two primary frameworks: a short-term technical rebound driven by trapped bearish bets, and a longer-term macroeconomic reality of tightening liquidity and high interest rates. This divergence matters because it defines the investment horizon—whether traders should prepare for a sharp, counter-trend rally or brace for months of consolidation as the market digests last year’s excesses. The debate is playing out in prediction markets. Users on Myriad , a prediction market owned by Decrypt 's parent company Dastan, now assign a 44% probability that Bitcoin’s next major move will be a rally to $84,000 rather than a fall to $55,000—a significant increase from 24.8% just last Friday, signaling a notable shift toward near-term bullishness. This contrasts with sentiment toward other major assets. On the same platform, users assign only a 30% chance that Ethereum’s next move will propel it to $3,000 instead of crashing to $1,500. For Hyperliquid, whose token weathered the recent selloff relatively well, users give only a 25% chance it becomes a top-10 crypto by market cap before March, reflecting continued skepticism toward altcoins altcoins . Some analysts see immediate fuel for a rebound in overcrowded bearish positioning. “In the immediate future, we expect a violent, upside expansion driven by a mechanical short squeeze,” Nicholas Motz, CEO of ORQO Group and CIO of Soil, told Decrypt . He argues that Bitcoin is decoupling from traditional macroeconomic headwinds and serving as a sovereign debt hedge. “As price refuses to break down, we anticipate a 'pain trade' where trapped shorts are forced to cover, sending the market vertical in a volatility-fueled rip,” Motz said. This aligns with the view that market structure itself may cushion further drastic falls, as noted in a previous Decrypt report , which highlighted whale accumulation, the extended nature of the spot CVD, and percent supply in profit among other on-chain metrics serving as indicators of a potential slowdown of the Bitcoin selloff. Sell-side pressure for Bitcoin, which last week brought the world’s largest crypto to its lowest point since President Donald Trump was elected for a second term, has begun to abate.\nAnalysts point to increasing demand from large buyers, the balance of aggressive buying and selling, and the percentage of supply in profit as evidence that the drawdown could be running out of steam.\n“From the perspective of price action and on-chain distribution, the pace of the decline is indeed decelerating,” Ti... “Market structure has matured significantly,” Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, told Decrypt . “Institutional participation is deeper, derivatives markets are more liquid... This tends to dampen extreme moves while reinforcing directional trends driven by macro signals.” Beyond positioning, analysts are watching where capital pauses on-chain. “Rather than calling the next move, it’s more revealing to watch where on-chain capital pauses,” Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare, told Decrypt . He pointed to stablecoin stablecoin supply as a key sentiment proxy. “Stablecoins have quietly become the macro buffer of crypto markets. Unlike earlier cycles, capital doesn’t automatically exit crypto during downturns, it parks on-chain.” Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company, announced Monday that it bought even more BTC last week even as its nearly $50 billion stash remains underwater following last week's crypto market plunge.\nThe firm purchased an additional 1,142 Bitcoin last week, currently valued around $79.3 million worth—though that purchase has already lost value. Strategy purchased the coins for approximately $90 million in total, with a cost basis of $78,815 per coin. Bitcoin was recently trading at $... This introduces a new dynamic for Bitcoin’s price path. “What’s different about this cycle... is that on-chain capital now has more places to go than just major cryptos,” Petrovcic explained, noting the rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like Treasurys and private credit as alternative liquidity sinks. “A market pullback doesn’t necessarily mean capital is leaving crypto, but it may simply be sitting in stablecoins, rotating toward yield and lower volatility,” the Blocksquare analyst said. The counter-argument paints a picture of a more prolonged downturn, with several experts pointing to historical cycles and a hostile macro backdrop. “We’re in the gravity phase of the cycle,” Connor Howe, CEO & Co-founder of E"

      "title": "Vitalik Buterin Calls for Ethereum-Led Alternative to the 'Race for AGI'",
      "source": "Decrypt",
      "summary": "### **Understanding the Article: Vitalik Buterin’s Call for an Ethereum-Led Alternative to the \"Race for AGI\"**\n\nIn late 2023, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of **Ethereum**—one of the world’s largest blockchain platforms—wrote a blog post titled *\"A Proposal for a Decentralized Alternative to the Race for AGI.\"* The term **AGI** stands for **Artificial General Intelligence**, which refers to highly advanced AI systems that could eventually perform any intellectual task a human can, including reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. Buterin’s post suggests that instead of a few powerful companies competing to build AGI (like a \"race\"), the development should be more open and decentralized, with Ethereum playing a key role in this effort.\n\nThis is a complex topic, so let’s break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Who is Vitalik Buterin?**\n\nVitalik Buterin is a software programmer and cryptocurrency researcher best known as the creator of **Ethereum**, the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin. A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and decentralized way. Ethereum, launched in 2015, is unique because it doesn’t just support cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) but also allows developers to build **smart contracts**—self-executing agreements written in code.\n\nButerin has been a major figure in the crypto industry for years. He was born in Russia in 1994 but moved to Canada with his family at a young age. He became interested in Bitcoin in 2011 and later proposed Ethereum as a way to make blockchain more programmable. His work has influenced not just Ethereum but also the broader idea of **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, where financial services like lending, trading, and insurance operate without traditional banks or intermediaries.\n\nButerin is also known for advocating for **decentralization**, meaning he believes important systems—like money, AI, or even governance—should not be controlled by a single company or government. Instead, they should be managed by a network of users and developers working together.\n\n---\n\n### **What is the \"Race for AGI\"?**\n\nThe **\"race for AGI\"** refers to the intense competition among tech companies to develop the first **Artificial General Intelligence**—a form of AI that can think, learn, and adapt like a human. Unlike today’s AI, which is specialized (e.g., AI for writing emails, playing chess, or recognizing images), AGI would be a general-purpose intelligence that could perform any task.\n\nSeveral companies are leading this race:\n\n1. **OpenAI** – Founded in 2015, OpenAI is a research lab focused on creating safe and beneficial AI. It developed **ChatGPT**, an AI chatbot that can write essays, answer questions, and even help with programming. OpenAI is backed by Microsoft, which has heavily invested in its technology.\n2. **Google DeepMind** – A division of Google, DeepMind specializes in AI research. It created **AlphaGo**, an AI that defeated a world champion in the complex game of Go, and later **AlphaFold**, which can predict protein structures in biology. Google has been working on AGI-like systems for years.\n3. **Meta (Facebook)** – Meta’s AI research lab, **FAIR (Fundamental AI Research)**, has developed models like **Llama**, a large language AI that competes with ChatGPT. Meta has also been experimenting with AI that can understand and generate human-like conversations.\n4. **Microsoft** – While not the sole leader, Microsoft has been a major investor in AI, particularly through its partnership with OpenAI. It uses AI to improve its cloud services, search engine (Bing), and productivity tools like Office.\n5. **Anthropic** – Another AI startup, backed by Google and others, that focuses on building \"helpful, honest, and aligned\" AI systems. Its model, **Claude**, is designed to be more controlled than some competitors.\n6. **Mistral AI** – A newer AI company based in France, backed by major investors like Google and Sequoia Capital. It has released **Mistral 7B**, a powerful AI model that some see as a potential competitor to OpenAI.\n\nThese companies are spending billions of dollars on AI research, hiring top scientists, and training massive models. The fear is that if one company succeeds in creating AGI first, it could gain too much control over this technology, leading to risks like misuse, monopolization, or even unintended consequences.\n\n---\n\n### **What Does Buterin Propose?**\n\nButerin argues that instead of a few companies racing to build AGI, the development should be **decentralized**—meaning many independent groups, researchers, and organizations could contribute to its creation and governance. He suggests using **Ethereum’s blockchain** and related technologies to achieve this.\n\nHere’s what his proposal includes:\n\n1. **Decentralized AI Research** – Instead of one company (like OpenAI or Google) controlling all AI development, Buterin wants a system where multiple teams can work on AGI without relying on a single entity. This would prevent a monopoly and allow for more diverse perspectives.\n\n2. **Open-Source AI Models** – Many AI models today are **proprietary**, meaning only the companies that built them can use or modify them. Buterin advocates for **open-source** models, where the code is publicly available for anyone to study, improve, or build upon. This is similar to how Ethereum itself was open-source from the start.\n\n3. **Ethereum as a Foundation** – Buterin believes Ethereum’s blockchain can help decentralize AI in several",
      "full_text": "Vitalik Buterin Calls for Ethereum-Led Alternative to the 'Race for AGI' Vitalik Buterin is calling for a different path in artificial intelligence—one that rejects a blind “race to AGI” and instead relies on Ethereum-style decentralization, verification, and privacy as guardrails for the AI era. “The frame of ‘work on AGI’ itself contains an error,” Ethereum co-founder Buterin wrote in a post on X Monday, noting that the goal is often treated as an undifferentiated race where the main distinction is simply “that you get to be the one at the top.” He compared the phrase to vaguely describing Ethereum as just “working in finance” or “working on computing,” saying it obscures more important questions about direction and values. Buterin said AI and crypto are too often approached from “completely separate philosophical perspectives,” and urged builders to integrate them. Instead of raw acceleration, AI development should focus on systems that “foster human freedom and empowerment” and ensure “the world does not blow up,” Buterin wrote, echoing his defensive-acceleration, or d/acc, framework. Joni Pirovich, founder and CEO of Crystal aOS, told Decrypt , “Ethereum becoming the default settlement layer for AI-to-AI interactions is realistic. It's less about 'accelerating AGI' and more about providing the necessary rails and guardrails for agentic commerce, trade, and investing. Trust and coordination, especially at the technology infrastructure and compliance infrastructure levels, are even more important now than ever.” The comments land as major AI firms continue to publicly push toward AGI and superintelligence, with leading labs describing rapid progress in autonomous agents and advanced models. Buterin claims his alternative centers on safer, more verifiable infrastructure rather than larger models, outlining a practical roadmap in which Ethereum plays a central, though not exclusive, role. That includes local LLM tooling, zero-knowledge payments that let users call AI APIs without linking identity across requests, stronger cryptographic privacy, and client-side verification of AI services and attestations. “Using Ethereum as an economic layer for AI-to-AI interaction is also directionally correct, but it will live mostly on rollups and app-specific L2s,” Midhun Krishna M, co-founder and CEO of LLM cost tracker TknOps.io , told Decrypt . Decentralized agent economies need programmable deposits, usage-based payments, and on-chain dispute resolution, Krishna said, adding that AI-augmented governance will require “identity, reputation, and stake-weighted accountability, not just better interfaces.” The Ethereum Foundation is launching a full-time team dead set on the network’s latest priority: becoming not just the bedrock of the AI economy, but also of AI software development at large.\nThe dAI team, named in a nod to Ethereum’s longstanding principles of decentralization and democracy, will focus its efforts both on fostering the development of AI systems within the crypto ecosystem and on bringing top players in the off-chain AI industry onto the network.\n“We want to bridge the gap betwe... Vitalik grouped the Ethereum–AI design space into a four-part framework, illustrated as a 2x2 chart, spanning infrastructure vs. impact and survive vs. thrive outcomes. One quadrant centers on tooling for trustless and private AI interaction, including local LLMs, zero-knowledge payments for anonymous API calls, cryptographic privacy upgrades, and client-side verification of AI services, TEE attestations, and proofs. Another quadrant positions Ethereum as an economic layer for AI activity, supporting API payments, bot-to-bot hiring, security deposits, on-chain dispute resolution, and AI reputation standards, such as proposed ERC-based models, aimed at enabling decentralized agent coordination rather than in-house platform control. A third focus revives the cypherpunk “don’t trust, verify” vision through local LLM assistants that can propose transactions, audit smart contracts, interpret formal verification proofs, and interact with apps without relying on centralized interfaces. A fourth targets upgraded prediction markets, quadratic voting, and governance systems. The comments echo a split that surfaced last year between Buterin and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who said his company was confident it knew how to build AGI and that AI agents could soon “join the workforce,” while Buterin promoted crypto-based safety rails and coordinated control mechanisms.
